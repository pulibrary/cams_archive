  <p>When cataloging a new print title, if the record contains an <b>856 field</b>, determine if the online item is a monograph, serial or database. <b>If the online version is anything other than a monograph</b>: Refer it to the <a href="../teams/unit4all.html">SERRM</a> team for processing. <br>
    <br>
    <b>If it is a monograph: </b></p>
  <li>If the information indicates that the link leads to a contents, index or abstract page or publisher’s page or other associated informational page, <b>do not check the link, and leave the 856 field as is. Do not add a MFHD</b>. <br>

  <br><br>
</li>
  <li>If there is no indication as to the nature of the link, or if it is indicated that the link leads you to a full text version, <b>check the URL link</b>:</li>
  <ol><li>If it appears to lead to the full text, <b>leave the link, but remove |z or |3 if present.</b> (Subfield z is only retained in special cases.)<img src="images/url2.gif"><br>
      <br><ul>
      <li>The record should have a 530 note. Accept the wording on the record or add the following:<img src="images/url3.gif" width="470" height="19"><br>
      <br></li>
      <li>Add an elf1 MFHD with |h Electronic Resource.<br><img src="images/url1.gif" width="373" height="20"><br>
      <br></li>
      </ul>
  </li><li>If it leads to abbreviated data, confusing data, or if the link doesn&rsquo;t work, remove<b> the entire 856 field.</b></p>
</ol>
  <p><em><span class="style3">Original</span>: </em></p>
  <p>If you know there is an electronic version, or you discover, in a brief inspection of the item, that there is an electronic version, make an attempt to find the URL for the e-version. Add the 530 &quot;Also available in an electronic version&quot; note, and, if you found a URL, also add an 856 field and a MFHD for location elf1 with |h Electronic Resource for the call number.</p>
  <b>NOTES:</b>
  <ul type=disc>
    <li>If a 530 note indicating an online version is present, but there is no 856 field, leave the note in and do not search for the URL.<br>
    <br></li>
    <li>Some series which are on standing order provide electronic access to all titles within the series (Example: Methods in Molecular Biology). Follow the <b>667 note</b> on the series authority record--usually this will not require adding the URL at time of cataloging<br>
      <img src="images/url4.gif"><br>
    <br></li>
    <li>If separate cataloging for an electronic version is requested by a selector, refer the request to the <a href="../teams/unit4all.html">SERRM</a> team.<br>
	<br></li>
    <li>URLs which link to one of our E-Book packages, such as Ebrary, or Books 24x7, are not part of this procedure and an 856 <b>should not</b> be added for them. These e-books are cataloged separately from their print counterparts.<br>
    <br></li>
    <li>Remove 5xx fields which relate specifically to another institution.<br>
    <br></li>
    <li> In cases of doubt, refer the item to the <a href="../teams/unit4all.html">SERRM</a> team.</li>
  </ul>
