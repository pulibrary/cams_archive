<p class="style3">FAQ for acquisitions: </p>
<p>What do I do if I am trying to order a print version and we have a catalog record for an electronic version?</p>
<ul>
  <li>    Attach the order to the existing bib record. </li>
</ul>
<p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style3">FAQ for cataloging:</p>
<p class="style2">How do I catalog a document that's been purchased as a PDF and printed locally?</p>
<ul>
  <li> Treat as a normal print publication except for the addition of the following 500 note:<br>
    500 Item distributed as PDF file for local printing, [date] |5 NjP<br>
    Use the date from the 904 field as the date for this note.
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="style2">How to I catalog a printout from the web when the web version has already been cataloged?</p>
<ul>
  <li> Add a 530 and new MFHD to the existing record.</li>
</ul>
<p class="style2">Do I create separate records for e-versions and printed versions of documents from the web?</p>
<ul>
  <li> No. In general we follow the single-record approach and catalog them both on the same record. In special cases a separate record may be desirable. The e-resources cataloging team will decide in these cases.</li>
</ul>
<p class="style2">How do I distinguish between a web printout and a purchased, locally-printed item?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Look for a note on the material specifying either purchase or web printout. If there is no note, look for the presence of a record in acquisitions--if there is an acq record, treat it as a purchased publication printed locally, if there is no acq record, treat it as a web printout. </li>
</ul>
