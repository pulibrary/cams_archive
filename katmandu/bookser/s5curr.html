      <h4>Introductory Note</h4>
      Please refer to the examples for the proper capitalization of: "Current 
      Volume In", "Next to Current Volume In", and "Current Volume Only". 
      <h4><a name=curr></a>Current Volume In</h4>
      Occasionally, a location in the library system wants to hold the most recent 
      volume of a continuing single issue (bind) serial, but wants to keep the 
      remainder of the set in another location. 
      <p> To account for this situation on the cataloging for a new title, it 
        is necessary to create two MFHD records -- one for the location of the 
        current volume of the serial, and one for the permanent location of the 
        serial. It is essential that the MFHD to which the acquisitions record 
        is attached is the one for the current volume. 
      <p> Although two MFHDs are created, the MARC holdings record of bound holdings 
        is kept on the location structure of the permanent (i.e. non-Current Volume) 
        location only. 
      <p> The item record containing the barcode, however, is added to the Current 
        volume location. 
      <p> <b>"Current Volume In" example</b> 
      <p> MFHD for F: 
      <p> 852 0_ |b f |h DS61.8 |i .G73<br>
        866 _0 |a 1998-2000<br>
        866 _0 |z CURRENT VOLUME IN: (SY)<br>
        866 _0 |x DESIGNATOR: year 
      <p> MFHD for SY: 
      <p> 852 0_ |b sy |h DS61.8 |i .G73<br>
        866 _0 |a CURRENT VOLUME 
      <p> In the example above (which is an annual publication) the 2000 volume 
        is located in SY and the 1988-1999 volumes are located in Firestone stacks. 
        Note that the record of bound volumes is kept on the Firestone location 
        structure. 
      <p> When a new volume is added to a "Current Volume In" record, the holdings 
        (on the permanent location MFHD) are updated. 
      <p> The volume itself is given the location symbol of the "Current Volume" 
        location (in the example above, it is SY). 
      <p> When SY receives the new volume, the previous volume is sent by SY to 
        DBIU to have the location on the volume changed to F. 
      <p>The location is changed in the volume, and on the spine, and the volume 
        is forwarded to its permanent location (in the example above, it is Firestone 
        stacks). the catalog record is not altered during the transfer to firestone 
        stacks. 
      <p> <a name=next></a> 
      <h4>Next to Current Volume In</h4>
      "Next to Current Volume In" is used when two locations wish to hold a recent 
      volume of a continuing single issue (bind) serial, without holding the remainder 
      of the volumes. 
      <p> To account for this situation on the cataloging for a new title, it 
        is necessary to create three MFHD records -- one for the location of the 
        current voume of the serial, one for the location of the next to current 
        volume of the serial, and one for the permanent location of the serial. 
      <p> Although three MFHDs are created for this situation; the record of bound 
        holdings is kept on the location structure of the permanent location only.

        866 _0 |a NEXT TO CURRENT VOLUME 
      <p> When a new volume is added to a "Next to Current Volume In" record, 
        the holdings (on the permanent location structure) are updated by the 
        Serial Record Unit. 
      <p> The volume itself is given the location symbol of the "Current Volume 
        In" location (in the example above, it is SG). 
      <p> When SG receives the new volume, the previous volume is sent by SG to 
        DBMS to have the location on the volume changed to ST. 
      <p> The location is changed in the volume and on the label, the item record 
        is attached to the appropriate MFHD, and the volume is forwarded to its 
        "Next to Current Volume In" location (in this case, it is ST). When ST 
        receives the volume, it sends its previous volume to DBMS to have the 
        location on the volume changed to F. 
      <p> The location is changed in the volume and on the label, the item record 
        is attached to the appropriate MFHD, and the volume is forwarded to its 
        permanent location (in the example above, it is Firestone stacks). 
      <p> The catalog record is not altered during the transfer from SG to ST 
        and during the transfer from ST to Firestone stacks. 
      <h4><a name=cvonly></a>Current Volume Only Retained</h4>
      "Current Volume Only Retained" (or "Current Edition Only Retained") occurs 
      when a location in the library system wants to hold the most recent volume 
      of a continuing single issue (bind) serial but older issues are not to be 
      retained. 
      <p> This may occur because:<br>
        1) The item is of current interest only and not worth retaining permanently.<br>
        2) The library is already retaining permanently the title.<br>
        3) Each new volume is cumulative, making previous volumes obsolete. 
      <p> In this situation, only one MFHD is required for each "Current Volume 
        Only Retained" location. This contrasts with "Curent Volume In" and "Next 
        to Current Volume In" in which two or three MFHDs are required. 
      <p> <b>"Current Volume Only Retained" example</b> 
      <p> 852 0_ |b dr |h HD4756 |i .S28 <br>
        866 _0 |x DESIGNATOR: vol. <br>
        866 _0 |a Vol. 10 (1993) <br>
        866 _0 |a CURRENT VOLUME ONLY RETAINED 
      <p>Note that in the example above the holdings are indicated in the location 
        structure of the "Current Volume Only Retained" location. The phrase: 
        "Current Volume Only Retained" (or "Current Edition Only Retained") is 
        recorded in an 866 field. 
      <p> When a new volume is added to a "Current Volume Only Retained" record, 
        the holdings are updated by the Serial Record Unit. Since only the current 
        volume will be retained, holdings will be removed and the new holdings 
        indicated. 
      <p> In the example above, when vol. 11 is received, the Serial Record Unit 
        will update the 866 to: Vol. 11 (1994). 
      <p> The volume itself is given the location symbol of the "Current Volume 
        Only Retained" location. 
      <p> When the "Current Volume Only Retained" location (in the example above, 
        it is DR) receives the volume, it sends its previous volume to DBMS to 
        withdraw. DBMS then withdraws the volume. 
      <p> The catalog record is not altered during the withdrawal. 
      <p> 
      <h4><a name=special></a>"Current Volume Only Retained" Not to be Bound : 
        A Special Case</h4>
      In a few exceptional cases, a library holding a "Current Volume Only Retained" 
      title requests that the title not be bound. 
      <p> The following are the additional steps required for such titles: 
      <p> 1. The title is treated as a bound volume with regard to type and placement 
        of GEAC labels. 
      <p> 2. The title is added to GEAC but NOT charged. 
      <p> 3. The title is hand carried to Plating and Labeling for the creation 
        of a spine label. 
      <p> 4. The cataloger or adder should send the book directly to the location 
        after the spine label has been made. 
      <p> 5. The notation: NOT TO BE BOUND is added as a ‡a:sl note in the ANT 
        field of the RLIN holdings screen. 
      <p> 
      <h4><a name=combo></a>Combination</h4>
      It is possible to have a combination of "Next to Current Volume In: (or 
      "Current Volume In") with "Current Volume Only Retained".
