      A biography is a written history of a person's life or a work about an individual's 
      contributions to a specific field.
      <p> Biographical works are classed under the topic with which the biographee 
        is most closely identified. However, when an individual who has contributed 
        to several different fields is the subject of a biography, the work is 
        assigned a classification determined by the topic covered in that particular 
        work.
      <p> If a biography treats multiple aspects of an individual's wide- ranging 
        life, the work is classed with the subject with which the biographee is 
        most commonly associated.
      <p> Library of Congress classifies biographies in two different ways, in 
        a general class and in a biography class.
      <p> A general class is any class in the Library of Congress classification 
        schedule other than a biography class.
      <p> For example in the pyschology class BF173, .A25-Z is the class for general 
        works including biographies about Freud. A biography class is any class 
        established in the Library of Congress classification schedule specifically 
        for biographical works. A biography class can include a collection of 
        an individual's letters or compilation of a person's speeches.
      <p> A work which discusses the lives and contributions of two or more individuals 
        is a collective biography. The biography table should not be used for 
        a collective biography. The work is cuttered as a general work.
      <p> For individual biographies under several topics in the classification 
        schedules, special classes termed biography classes have been established 
        especially for biographical works. Such works are clearly identified as 
        an individual biography and may include materials such as collected works, 
        selected works, autobiographies, letters, and speeches.

      If the main entry of a biographical or critical work begins with A and the 
      work is classed in a biography class, do not cutter lower than A6. See the 
      <a href="./a6.html">.A6-.A99 table</a> for the suggested cutters for entries 
      beginning with <b>A</b>.
      <p> When a biography class is set up in the schedule so that the cutter 
        which represents the biographee is the second cutter, do not use the Biography 
        table. Instead, establish a span of numbers to represent the biographee.
      <p> There are also other tables for biographical works; in these cases one 
        must distinguish between classes about individuals which use the Biography 
        table and those classes which use a separate table which is only contained 
        within the schedule, e.g. the <a href="./artists.html">Individual artists's 
        file</a>,<a href="./litaut.html"> Literary authors</a>, and <a href="./ml410.html">ML410</a> 
        and ML420.
      <p> When the first subject heading of a work consists of a personal name 
        plus the term "personal narratives" and the work is classed in a biography 
        class, the work is treated as an autobiography.
      <p> Some biography classes have the term "personal narratives" included 
        in the schedule; however, if the class is specified for personal narratives 
        only, it is<b> not </b>considered a biography class. Here as in a general 
        class, a personal narrative is treated as a separate work of the author.
      <p> Some history classes are divided by period according to the reigns of 
        individuals rulers. In these classes, no distinction is made between biographies 
        of the ruler and general works about the period. Cutter all works for 
        the main entry, even works by the ruler.
      <p> Note that even though the schedule may indicate that a general class 
        includes biographies that class is not considered a biography class. Only 
        use the biography table when a work is classed in a biography class. Do 
        not use the Biography table in classes that state "Include biography" 
        or "Including biographies."
