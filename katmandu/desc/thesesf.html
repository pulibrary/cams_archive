Descriptive Cataloging 
<center>
  <h2>Princeton Theses</h2></center>
(Sept. 24, 1991) rev. Sept. 1, 1993<p>


There are always at least two copies of a thesis: one for Archives and one for another location.  In general, the copy in hand is the non-archival copy.  The location symbol for the Archives copy is (P); the location symbol for the non-archival copy is specified on an orange "Special" flyer.  Non-archival copies that are not cataloged for a branch library are located in Annex A (until Sept. 1, 1993 they were cataloged for Firestone stacks; changed to Annex at that time and all Firestone copies were transferred to the Annex).  Both copies are represented in the catalog record.

<h3>Call Numbers</h3>

Call numbers are based on the PRIN sequence.  Assign call numbers according to the following patterns.  The type of degree is specified on the title page of the thesis.<p>

<center>PH.D.     \PRIN\685 \[year degree awarded] \.[cutter number]<br>
M.A.     \PRIN\6846 \[year degree awarded] \.[cutter number]<br>
M.S.E.     \PRIN\6848 \[year degree awarded] \.[cutter number]</center><p>

Cutter numbers are derived from the tables.  To control call numbers, the cataloger will maintain a file of FUL printouts for the current year.  Verify each cutter number against the year's call number file, and adjust them as necessary to prevent duplication an maintain shelf order.  Limit cutters to 4 digits if possible, but assign more if conditions warrant.  Do not end cutter numbers with zero.

<h3>NACO</h3>

Prepare NACO forms for thesis authors not in the NAF.  Cite only the work in hand in the 670 field.  In case of ambiguity or conflict contact Archives for more information on the author.  Cite any such information as "Info. from Princeton U. Archives, [date]‡b ([information]).  When contacting Archives be sure to ask for complete information, such as full name, birth date, etc.<p>

<h3>Genre Term and Department Name</h3>

Include in every record the two following fields for special access.<p>

1.  G55<img align=bottom src="../gifs/blank.gif">7     Academic dissertations‡2rbgenr<p>

2.  710 20     [Heading for the Princeton department, school program, etc. to which the thesis was submitted; prepare NACO form if necessary, based on the title-page form of name.]<p>

<h3>Location/Copies</h3>

<b>Archives copy:</b>  assign location P.<br>
<b>Non-Archival copy: </b>    assign the location specified.  Those that are not cataloged for a branch library will be located in Annex A.<p>

<h3>Special Situations</h3>

<b>1. Supplementary Materials.</b><p>

These always have two copies of text, but sometimes only one copy of supplementary materials bound separately (e.g., plates).  Full holdings should always be recorded for the Archives copy (location P).  Information about the Archives copy should accompany the non-archival copy in hand; if in doubt consult Archives.<p>

<b>2.  Music Theses</b><p>

Sometimes dissertations in music are submitted in two parts: a composition and an essay.  In such cases each part is cataloged independently.  Refer the composition to the Music Cataloger for cataloging as a score.  In each record include a 500 note explaining the relationship, based on the following model.<p>
<center>[on record for music]</center><p>
This composition and the essay "[Title proper of text]" together constitute the dissertation but are otherwise unrelated.<p>

<center>[on record for text]</center><p>

This essay and the composition '[Title proper of music]" together constitute the dissertation but are otherwise unrelated.<p>

Assignt eh same call number to both volumes, treating the music as Volume 1 and the text as Volume 2.<p>

<h3>Printouts </h3>

Make a PAR printout as usual for DBMS.  Make an extra PAR to send to Archives as notification of the call number.  Also make a FUL printout for the year's call number file.<p>

<h3>Historical Note</h3>

Theses accepted before 1992 and cataloged for Annex were treated as copy 2 of 
location (P). This practice was changed per Library Council decision in 1991
