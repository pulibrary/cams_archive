        <h5 align="left">Loeb Classics</h5>
        <font color="#0000FF">**This procedure is under review. Parenthetical 
        info. is from handwritten additions<br>
        to the printed procedure--mostly in Jeff's handwriting. **</font> 
      </center>
<CENTER>
  <h5>Goals of the Project</h5>
</CENTER>
<ul>
        <li>Convert or correct records for the Loeb series <font color="#0000FF">(98% 
          converted)</font> 
        <li>Transfer volumes to correct locations
<li>Get a reliable inventory of holdings for primary locations of the set
</ul>

<CENTER>
  <h5>Current Situation</h5>
</CENTER>
Full or partial sets may be located as follows:
      <p> 1. FSET: Firestone stacks, CAS <font color="#0000FF">(remove CAS)</font><br>
        2. FSEP: Firestone stacks, classed separately <font color="#0000FF">(most 
        recalssed as c. 2, etc. in FSET)</font><br>
3. Clas [located in error]<br>
        4. SC <font color="#0000FF">(set#)</font><br>
        5. SE <font color="#0000FF">(set#?)</font><br>
        6. SA <font color="#0000FF">(LC clas.)</font><br>
7. Other locations, e.g., SM<p>

FSET and SC are primary locations; FSEP and Clas volumes will be transferred and reclassified to them.<p>

<CENTER>
  <h5>Workflow</h5>
</CENTER>
Tasks are divided between Catalog Division and DBMS as follows:<p>

<b>Catalog Division</b><p>

Catalog Division staff will convert records, or adjust existing RLIN records, according to establised guidelines.  This may involve deleting Card Catalog or RLIN records and merging the information on them onto a composite record that covers all "editions," issues, etc., with the same title and division into volumes.  Staff will complete the bibliographic segment of records and a basic holdings segment comprising locations and call numbers.  Save records are forwarded to DBMS for completion of holdings and final production.<p>

<b>DBMS </b>
      <p> DBMS staff will retrieve and transfer FSEP or Clas volumes to FSET or 
        SC, in that order of preference. If a volume is already held in both locations, 
        add it as copy 2 (etc.) to FSET. <font color="#0000FF">(don't retrieve 
        and transfer FSEP or Clas volumes unless fixing something else)</font>
<p>

<CENTER>
    <img src="images/loeb.gif" width="378" height="265">
</CENTER>
DBMS will add holdings to the catalog record, in the process verifying holdings for SE, SC and FSET.  SC will always be checked for possible additional copies.  Holdings for other locations are accepted as available.  The summary holdings statement (LVOL) will reflect only the basic volume number for each location, with no attempt to specify printings, etc.  DBMS staff will then produce the save record.<p>

Shelflist cards are pulled by DBMS, as necessary and the Electronic Card Catalog is cleared as necessary.<p>

<CENTER>
  <h5>Cataloging Guidelines </h5>
</CENTER>

      <b>NOTE</b>. These guidelines apply only to "editions", issues, etc., that retain 
      the <em>original title</em> and the original format or division into volumes. 
      <strong>If the title changes or if volumes are issued in a new pattern, 
      catalog the new edition separately</strong>. However, consider whether the 
      new cataloging would benefit from using elements of this procedure. In any 
      case, always use cataloger's judgment, keeping in mind the goals of the 
      project. <font color="#0000FF">(interpret broadly)</font> 
      <p>

Work from the main card and the shelflist cards.  Forward a photocopy of the main card (including the back of the card if necessary) plus any shelflist cards to DBMS along with the RLIN record(s).  Return the main card to the Card Catalog.
      <p> To accomodate past practice and minimize future updating, catalog records 
        should include all "editions", issues, printings, etc., as described above. 
        Some areas of the description will not necessarily match current standards. 
        Change copy in any way needed to follow these guidelines. <font color="#0000FF">(Where 
        future publication pattern is unknown or unclear, consider cataloging 
        individual vols. separately as per LC)</font>
      <p>

<b>CC:</b>  9914<p>
<b>EL:</b> 7<p>
<b>245:</b>  Do not transcribe the statement of editor, translator, etc.  Instead, put this information in a note, as shown below.<p>

<b>260:</b> Use as on the earliest volume covered by the record, if this can be determined from cards or from RLIN.  If not, use a later imprint.  Use the note "Imprint varies" to indicate variants from the transcribed information. <p> Leave the date open if there is any evidence of variant printings, issues, "editions", etc., as expressed on existing records.  If a date is initially closed, it may be opened later if new volumes of a variant printing, etc., are added.<p>

<b>300:</b> Record as it appears on the card.<p>

<b>440:</b> Use "Loeb classical library" in all cases, without numbers and without "subseries."<p>

<b>500:</b> To make the record as inclusive as possible, use the following notes as needed:<p><ul>
<li>Editor, translator, etc.:  List editors, translators, etc., in one note.  Begin the note with "Editors:".  Trace all editors who would have been given an added entry had each edition been cataloged separately.<p>

<li>Imprint:  Use "Imprint varies" in most cases.<p>

        <li><font color="#0000FF">(504)</font> Bibliographical references, index, 
          etc.: Use a general note, without citing page numbers. 
          <p>

        <li>Contents: Generally do not transcribe a formal contents note, since 
          titles, etc. may vary between "editions." If one is necessary, prefer 
          an informal note. N.B. Check individual titles to see if previous "editions," 
          etc., were cataloged separately. <font color="#0000FF">(replace this 
          with -- Contents: Transcribe a formal contents note, since titles, etc. 
          may vary between editions. N.B. Check individual titles to see if previous 
          &quot;editions&quot;, etc. were cataloged separately)</font> 
          <p></ul>

      <b>CALL:</b> Do not use this field; use LCAL in every case. <font color="#0000FF">(remove 
      this bit)</font> 
      <p> <b>MDES:</b> For added volumes, always include the latest printing/publication 
        date after the volume designator. Take the date from the t.p. verso or 
        t.p.: <font color="#0000FF">(change MDES to: Item record CHRON)</font>
      <p>

<i>vol. 1 1991</i><p>

If the printing date of a subsequent added volume duplicates that of one already in the collection, add it as Copy 2 of that printing.<p>

<b>LVOL:</b>  Record the basic volume numbers for each location; do not attempt to specify each printing, etc.<p>

<i>LVOL  vol.1-2</i><p>

<CENTER>
  <h5>Added Volumes</h5>
</CENTER>

Convert or adjust the record to fit the preceding guidelines.  Forward the record to DBMS along with the volume(s) being added.<p>
