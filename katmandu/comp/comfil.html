      <h5>Cataloging CD-ROMs and Computer Disks</h5>
      <P>CD-ROMs and computer disks are cataloged according to their content. 
        The cataloger should determine if the item is a monograph, serial, database 
        or software program and catalog it in the books (bks), serial (ser) or 
        computer file (mdf) format as appropriate. Be sure to search all files 
        for copy for the item. If copy is only available in a file which the cataloger 
        will not be using, use the "TRA DER" or "TRA CRE*" transfer commands to 
        move the copy to the chosen file. For help in determining the correct 
        file, see <A HREF="./concarrier.html"><B>Content Versus Carrier (Electronic 
        Resources)</B></A></P>
      <B> 
      <P>Definition</P>
      </B> 
      <P>CD-ROM is short for compact-disc read-only memory. The disc is used for 
        the permanent storage of data or audio or video recordings. This document 
        covers discs (or disks in the case of computer disks) that contain data. 
      </P>
      <B> 
      <P>Disc or disk</P>
      </B> 
      <P>Disc is the word used to indicate optical storage devices (CD-ROMs and 
        compact discs). On older records the word "disk" will appear. Disk now 
        refers to other computer contexts, such as floppy disk, hard disk, etc.</P>
      <B> 
      <P>Chief source of information </P>
      </B> 
      <P>The chief source for cataloging CD-ROMs and computer disks is the title 
        screen. Several alternate chief sources are listed in revised Chapter 
        9 of AACR2. In practice we will most often be cataloging from the CD-ROM 
        or computer disk label. Always, make a note in the catalog record showing 
        what was chosen as the chief source, e.g., <I>Title from title screen</I> 
        or <I>Title from label on disc.</i></P>
      <b>Fixed fields</b> 
      <P>For assistance with fixed fields and values see: <A HREF="http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/ecbdhome.html"><B>LC's 
        MARC documentation</B></A>. Refer also to Princeton Policy in the MARC 
        format section of the documentation in regard to the use of <A HREF="../policies/006prin.html"><B>006</B></A> 
        and <A HREF="../policies/007prin.html"><B>007</B></A> fields.</P>
      <h5>Variable fields </h5>
      <P>Attention should be paid to the following fields (some of which are unique 
        to computer files). Other fields are used in the usual manner where appropriate.</P>
      <B> 
      <P>130 (uniform title)</P>
      </B> 
      <P>For serials: Provide a uniform title as usual if the title conflicts 
        with an unrelated serial publication. In addition, if the print title 
        and its CD-ROM (or computer disk) counterpart have the same title, provide 
        a uniform title indicating the specific computer file format using a qualifier 
        such as (CD-ROM) or (Computer disk). </P>
      <B> 
      <P>24x (titles)</P>
      </B> 
      <P>General material designator (GMD) for CD-ROMs and computer disks is <I>&#135;h[electronic 
        resource]</I> The 245 title is taken from the chief source as indicated 
        above. Title variations often appear in accompanying material, etc. These 
        should be added as a 246 field. </P>
      <B> 
      <P>250 (edition) </P>
      </B> 
      <P>The term "version" is often used to distinguish between alternate computer 
        file formats. If the term "CD version" appears, include this in the 250 
        field.</P>
      <B> 
      <P>256 (file characteristics: MDF ONLY) </P>
      </B> 
      <P>Usually <I>Computer data</I> for CD-ROMs.</P>
      <B> 
      <P>260 (imprint)</P>
      </B> 
      <P>Many computer file titles are issued by a commercial publisher who may 
        have nothing to do with the original print version, e.g.: SilverPlatter 
        Information. In general these publishers are not traced. Non commercial 
        bodies associated with the intellectual content of the title are traced 
        as usual.</P>
      <B> 
      <P>300 (physical description area)</P>
      </B> 
      <P>The physical unit for the CD-ROM is<I> computer optical discs</I> The 
        &#135;c is always 4 3/4 in. The physical unit for computer disks is <I>computer 
        disks</I>. The &#135;c is always 3 1/2 in. The small guide, which is often 
        enclosed within the jewel case, can be described here, e.g., <I>+&#135;e 
        guide (15 p. ; 12 cm.)</I> Other larger manuals, installation discs, etc. 
        are usually described in a note.</P>
      <B> 
      <P>362 (designation : SERIALS ONLY)</P>
      </B> 
      <P>Often is an unformatted note with information from accompanying material, 
        e.g., <I>Began with Mar. 1991. 1980-1989 issued on one retrospective disc; 
        1990, 1991 issued on annual discs.</I> The "earliest" issue may be difficult 
        to determine where discs are cumulative. It is often necessary to use 
        the 'Description based on' note.</P>
      <B> 
      <P>500 (notes)</P>
      </B> 
      <P>Accompanying material: Describe in a 500 field the manuals, guides and 
        installation discs, etc. which are either too numerous or complicated 
        to describe in the 300 field. <I>Accompanied by installation and retrieval 
        software on two 5 1/4 in. disks and reference manual.</I><BR>
        The Description based on note for serials is also added as a 500 note:<BR>
        <I>Description based on: [earliest disc available]; title from disc label.</i></P>
      <B> 
      <P>515 (numbering irregularities: SERIALS ONLY)</P>
      </B> 
      <P>Often used to describe the date of coverage and cumulation patterns: 
        <I>Backfile covers 1973-1983; current discs are cumulative and cover 1984 
        through the current quarter.</i></P>
      <B> 
      <P>530 (additional physical form note)</P>
      </B> 
      <P>CD-ROMs often have titles that vary from their print counterparts. An 
        attempt should be made in these cases to add a note and added entry for 
        the title of the print version. Use a 530 note and add a 776 field.<BR>
        <I>530 CD-ROM ed. of: Current contents. Life sciences.<BR>
        776 1 &#135;tCurrent contents. Life sciences</I> </P>
      <P>If the CD-ROM includes more than one title, the note/tracing described 
        above should also be applied.</P>
      <I> 
      <P>530 CD-ROM ed. of: American statistics index; Statistical reference index; 
        and: Index to international statistics. 776 1 &#135;tAmerican statistics 
        index<BR>
        776 1 &#135;tStatistical reference index<BR>
        776 1 &#135;tIndex to international statistics</P>
      </I><B> 
      <P>538 (system requirements)</P>
      </B> 
      <P>Contains system information about the equipment needed to run the CD-ROM. 
        Use this information if included with the item and readily available:</P>
      <I> 
      <P>System requirements: IBM PC or compatible; 4 MB RAM; MS-DOS 3.1 or higher; 
        CD- ROM drive.</P>
      </I><B> 
      <P>6xx (subject headings)</P>
      </B><B></B> 
      <P>If the item is available in another format use the same subject headings 
        if still valid.</P>
      <B> 
      <P>Some Guidelines for Computer File Related Subject Subdivisions</P>
      </B> 
      <P><I>Databases</i> [Form subdivision]<BR>
        Use under subjects as a form subdivision for actual databases or as a 
        topical subdivision for works on databases on those subjects.</P>
      <P><I>Software</i> (H2070) [Form subdivision]<BR>
        Use under topical headings for actual software items, i.e. machine-readable 
        editions.</P>
      <P><I>Computer programs</i> (H 2070) Use under topical headings for works 
        on computer programs, whether or not lists of machine instructions are 
        included.</P>
      <B> 
      <P>753 (technical details)</P>
      </B> 
      <P>This is a searchable field that provides information about system requirements 
        noted in the 538 field. We no longer use this field, but it may appear 
        on older records.</P>
      <B> 
      <P>780/785 (Continues:/Continued by: SERIALS ONLY)</P>
      </B> 
      <P>If a CD ROM changes title, add appropriate continued by notes to the 
        old title and treat the title change as a new title as per normal serial 
        cataloging procedures.<BR>
        NOTE: If a CD ROM is cumulative, however, you will have to delete the 
        record for the previous title.</P>

      <P>See <I>CONSER Cataloging Manual</I>, module 30 for more detailed information 
        and examples.</P>
      <h5>Local information </h5>
      <B> 
      <P>Call number</P>
      </B> 
      <P>CD-ROMs should be given accession numbers. Make a permanent card for 
        the shelflist and use the next available number for the particular location. 
        Catalogers should go up to the shelflist and do this themselves.</P>
      <P>The accession number should appear in the 852 field on the holdings screen 
        as: COMPUTER FILE 12<BR>
        Always use capitals.</P>
      <h5>Location</h5>
      <P>CD-ROMs are only to be placed in locations that have the appropriate 
        computer equipment. This includes most branch libraries and the various 
        reference locations. CD-ROMs and computer disks should never be assigned 
        to Firestone stacks, except in the case of accompanying material. <BR>
        FILMB is the designated location for CD-ROMs and computer disks not ordered 
        by a specific location. <BR>
        ELF2 is the CD-ROM tower designation. Send these materials to the Systems 
        Office after cataloging.</P>
      <h5>Holdings</h5>
      <P>No holdings data for serials are maintained in Technical Services for 
        CD-ROM and computer disk titles. Add the following 866 note to the holdings 
        record for all CD-ROMs and computer disks that are cumulative, i.e. for 
        which each issue supersedes previous versions :</P>
      <P>866 _0 &#135;a FOR HOLDINGS CONSULT ( ) LIBRARY</P>
      <P>For true serials, the same note is added, except for FilmB. For FilmB 
        titles add the issues being cataloged. Subsequent holdings will be maintained 
        by FilmB. Other locations have the option of requesting that holdings 
        be added after new issues are received. <B>Exception:</B> For CD-ROM's 
        installed on a tower, DO NOT add any note or holdings. No holdings are 
        included for these titles.</P>
      <h5>Post cataloging</h5>
      <P>Barcodes are not assigned or affixed to CD-ROMs and their associated 
        documentation. For information on marking the item see: <A HREF="../phystrea/callcd.html">Physical 
        Treatment and Marking of CD-ROMs, Sound Discs, Computer Disks.</A> Make 
        a printout of the OPAC record and mail it with the CD-ROMs and accompanying 
        material to the appropriate location.</P>
