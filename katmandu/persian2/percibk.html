<h3>Citing the book in hand</h3></center>

	
<h4>Titles</h4>	
     In the 670 for the piece in hand cite only the title(s) immediately preceeding the name. <br> Titles should be capitalized according to the following lists:<p><ul>

	<b>always in caps.</b><br>
	<i>
	Shaykh<br>
	Imam	<br>
	Ayat Allah<br>
           Hujjat al-Islam</i><br>
<br>
<b>only in caps. immediately bef. name</b><br>
	<i>ustadh<br>
	sayyid</i></ul>
	
<h4>Citing main entry (when necessary)</h4>
     If the work is entered under the name being established, use <i>His, Her</i>, or <i>Author's</i> in the 670.  If the work is entered under a different name, cite the entry element of that name in full, followed by abbreviated forms for the other elements in that name.<ul> 
    <li> <b>Ibn</b> is abbreviated with a lower-case "b." 
<li> A single letter in Persian which is romanized using two characters should be abbreviated using both characters (Sh., Kh.). 
<li> Names with definite articles are abbreviated using the article and the appropriate character(s) (al-Hasan becomes al-H.; al-Shams becomes al-Sh.).</ul><p>  
     All letters retain their diacritics.  There are no spaces between abbreviated letters except those with more than one character in the abbreviated form--these get a space before and after.<p>

<h4>Examples</h4><ul>
Baghdadi, M.b. al-H.<br>
Ibn al-Lamish, A.B. Kh.<br>
Duraydi, Sh. al-D. b.M.H.</ul>

For other information about citing from the source in hand, (booksets, complex page numbering, etc.) consult the general authorities procedure.
