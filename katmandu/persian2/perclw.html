<h3>What is a classical author?</h3></center>

A classical author is one active prior to the 20th century.  Any author who died before 1900 is treated as classical. <p>
 Authors whose life spanned the 19th and 20th centuries may be treated as modern if it is determined that they were primarily active during the 20th century.
