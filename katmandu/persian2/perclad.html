<h3>Choice of additional elements for classical authors</h3></center>

	The entry element must be determined <b>before</b> additional elements are chosen.  According to 22.22C1, if the entry element is not the <i>ism</i> or a <i>patronymic derived from the father</i>, these elements should be<b> included</b> in the heading "unless they are not customarily used in the name by which the person is known"--i.e., unless his name is well-known and short like that of <i>Hafiz, Sadi</i> etc.<p>

	Rule 22.22C1 also calls for the addition of "an additional name, descriptive epithet, or term of honour that is treated as part of the name if it aids in identifying the individual".  LC practice is to add additional names very seldom, apparently in accord with the statement in 22.22C1, "<b>Generally omit other elements</b> of the name, particularly patronymics derived from anyone other than the father."
