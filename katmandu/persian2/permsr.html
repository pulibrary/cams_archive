<h3>Referrals from other teams</h3></center><p>

	Names of Iranian origin referred from other teams should be <b>searched</b> for LC in RLIN and in the NAF as they appear on the item, as well as in a Persianized form.  If it is not established in either form establish it as follows:

<ul>
<li>	<B>Classical names</B>: follow the guidelines for establishing the name from reference sources as you would any classical name, and make appropriate references from the forms found on the item.
</ul>


<ul><li>
<B>Modern names</B>:
<ul>
<li>If the name appears somewhere on the item in <b>Persian</b>, it may be established in Persian if appropriate--i.e., if there is evidence that the person writes primarily in Persian, or if the person is the subject of the book.<p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If the name only appears in a <b>romanized</b> form, it must be established as it appears unless the name is significant enough to be found in modern reference sources in either English or Persian, in which case the heading and dates from the reference source may be used.  If the romanized form is used, an arbitrary reference from the most likely Persian form should be given.  (Only one arbitrary reference should be given.)<p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If the work is a <b>translation</b> from Persian and no Persian form is available, the name will be established from the romanized form and made provisional.
