<h3>Choice of entry element for classical authors</h3></center>

The entry element may be any of the various elements of a name--<i>khitab, kunyah, ism, patronymic, laqab</i> or <i>nisbah</i>.  "Determine this from reference sources" (22.22B1), keeping in mind that the piece in hand is a reference source, though a low-ranking one as regards choice of entry element.<p>

If the author is very well-known, or if the classical person is not an author, reference sources such as the <i>Encyclopedia of Islam</i>, <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, <I>Encyclopaedia Iranica</I>, etc. may be consulted and their data (dates, etc.) quoted in headings as they appear.  Otherwise, <b>consult at least one</b> reference source aside from the piece in hand as follows:<p>
<ul>
<li>If the author is found in <b>Fihrist-i mustanad</b>, choose the element(s) in the entry-heading as the entry element.<p>

<li>If the author is not found in Fihrist-i mustanad, consult <b>Storey</b> or any other reference source.  If the author is found in any source othern than Fihrist-i mustanad, use the entry element(s) as found and provide references as appropriate.<p>


<li>If the author is not found in any reference sources, choose as the entry element a surname in this order:
<ul><li><B>takhallus</B></ul>
<ul><li>phrases marked <B>maruf bih</B>, <B>mashhur bih</B>, etc.</ul>
<ul><li>any <b>unusual</b> surname (i.e., not derived froma place-name or a madhhab)
</ul>
<ul><li>a surname derived from a <b>place-name</b> (i.e., Isfahani)
</ul>
<ul><li>a surname derived from a <b>madhhab</b> (i.e., Shafii)
</ul>
<p>
If there are no surnames, choose the element(s) following the ism and father-patronymic, if any (i.e. Ibn al-Lamish in Ahmad ibn Ali ibn al-Lamish).  If there are no such elements, enter the ism and father-patronymic in direct order.
</ul>

Note:  In citing a second or third reference source, quote the name in full.
