<p>Greek-Turkish names </p>
<p>The following table of  names was reproduced  from Vasiles Pan. Kekes' book, He dikia mas Kappadokia. The original list contained only the  Greek form of modern and ancient cities. The table is an attempt to compile  in one page the Greek-Turkish names which may be encountered in cataloging. As such, it is not complete, nor meant to be but is rather, is a continuing work in progress. Contributions from specialist in Turkish history are invited and input would be most welcomed particularly to resolve the blank boxes where no corresponding Turkish form has been found..</p>
<p>Links to more comprehensive lists of city/town names are posted below.  The most comprehensive list is in Turkish. </p>
