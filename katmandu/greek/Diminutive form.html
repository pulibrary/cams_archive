<title>Diminutive form of names</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>The forms of Male fore- and sur-names were discussed on the Personal  Names page of this site, where the rule of thumb for determining male gender  was the presence of a final &ldquo;s&rdquo; in the Nominative (subject) case. </p>
<p>In Greece,  a diminutive form of first names is quite common.&nbsp; You may encounter variant forms of first  names in their shortened form.&nbsp; If an  author&rsquo;s name appears on the title page in its abbreviated form, it may be  difficult to determine gender or to know the full form of the name (should the  author have published using the fuller form).&nbsp;  An excellent book on the subject of Greek first names is Ta Neoell&#275;nika  kyria onomata (Theod&#333;ros Seremetak&#275;s, Maria D&#275;m&#275;triou : Ath&#275;na : Ekdoseis Patak&#275;,  2003).&nbsp; On this page, you will find a  summary and list of the most common forenames, male and female, with their  corresponding abbreviated forms compiled from the book</p>
<p>As is the case with Greek surnames, the diminutive, or  abbreviated form of forenames, once studied, follows a fairly predictable order.</p>
<p>The two most common masculine diminutives are : (p. 26)<br />
  &nbsp;Ak&#275;s &nbsp;- short for: Gi&#333;rgak&#275;s, D&#275;m&#275;trak&#275;s, Thod&#333;rak&#275;s <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  Akos&nbsp; - short for: Vasilakos,  Thod&#333;rakos, Kyriakos&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To name a few.</p>
<p>The suffix ending &nbsp;&ndash;er&#275;s  &nbsp;is often the diminutive form of male forenames  ending in &ndash;os</p>
<p>Liver&#275;s ; Artem&#275;s; Vlas&#275;s ; Gr&#275;gor&#275;s&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full form<br />
  Liverios ; Artemios ; Vlasios;&nbsp; Gr&#275;gorios</p>
