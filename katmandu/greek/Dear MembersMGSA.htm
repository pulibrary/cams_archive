  <DIV id="petition_body">We, the undersigned, protest the new Modern Greek   transliteration table mandated by the Library of Congress   (http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/greekm.pdf) and insist that the   changes to transliteration practices be tabled indefinitely. The most   significant change involves removing or omitting the romanized h (that   represents the rough breathing in the transliteration of polytonic Greek) in   bibliographic and authority records for all monotonic Greek but also instructs   the cataloger to retain the h in cases where the word is written in polytonic   Greek. Thereby, the LC mandate splits Modern Greek publications into monotonic   and polytonic subsets, which has serious consequences for library professionals   and researchers, such as: <BR>
    <BR>
    The LC mandate assumes that researchers and   public services staff are aware whether modern Greek publications with which   they are working or searching are monotonic or polytonic Greek. <BR>
    <BR>
    The LC   mandate will require catalogers and technical services staff to have advanced   knowledge of Greek in order to implement the tables properly. <BR>
    <BR>
    The LC   transliteration table offers the following guidelines for identification which   may be confusing to most users and library professionals: <BR>
    Katharevousa, an   archaizing form of modern Greek, is written in polytonic orthography. Demotic,   the colloquial form, can be written in either polytonic or monotonic. In 1976,   demotic became the official language of Greece; in 1982, monotonic became the   official orthography. <BR>
    If it is not evident whether the text to be romanized   is in polytonic or monotonic orthography, examine the rest of the item. If that   provides no information, consider an item issued before 1982 to be in polytonic,   and an item issued in 1982 or later to be in monotonic. <BR>
    <BR>
    The LC mandate   will force researchers to search Greek words beginning with vowels in two   different ways: with and without the rough breathing. For example: Hetaireia   Hellenikou Logotechnikou kai Historikou Archeiou and Etaireia Ellenikou   Logotechnikou kai Istorikou Archeiou. The mandate fails to consider whether   researchers will know if a specific item for which they are searching used   monotonic or polytonic Greek and/or if the catalog record for a post-1982 item   has undergone retrospective conversion. <BR>
    <BR>
    The LC mandate will necessitate   the retrospective cleanup of bibliographic records for Greek publications dating   between 1982 and 2010 as well as changes to an even larger number of existing   authority files. Otherwise, the mandate creates an arbitrary dividing line   between pre-2010 and post-2010 records that will confuse users and library   professionals alike. <BR>
    <BR>
    Retrospective cleanup will require complex machine   conversions. Among the possible complications: <BR>
    o Machine conversions will   need to distinguish monotonic Greek from polytonic Greek and from other   languages (for ex. parallel titles in English) in bibliographic records. <BR>
    o   Non-filing indicators in the MARC 245 field will need to be changed for every   title that begins with the definite articles &omicron;, &eta;, &omicron;&iota;, and &alpha;&iota; for monotonic   Greek publications but left as-is for post-1982 polytonic Greek publications. <BR>
    o Serials records for Greek publications will need to be split to reflect   those publications that switched from polytonic orthography to monotonic   orthography between 1982 and the present. <BR>
    <BR>
    Because of the complications   of machine conversion, technical services staff will need to review many   physical items and bibliographic records manually. <BR>
    <BR>
    Libraries with large   modern Greek collections are anticipating that such a conversion project will   affect upwards of 50,000 titles in their possession. <BR>
    <BR>
    Presently, many   libraries struggle with limited resources. It is likely that most libraries with   modern Greek holdings will be unable to participate in an expensive and complex   retrospective conversion project. This means that catalog records using the   older standards will persist in many catalogs. <BR>
    <BR>
    The LC mandate includes   updating existing authority files to reflect monotonic Greek. The recommendation   of LCs Policy and Standards Division is that [authority] headings would be   revised as necessary on the first occurrence of cataloging a resource in   monotonic Greek. As is the policy (AACR2, 24.2C and LCRI 24.2C), headings   romanized from languages having undergone orthographic reform are revised to   reflect the new orthography with reference from the form in the old orthography.   Delays will compromise the integrity of existing authority files and their value   to researchers. <BR>
    <BR>
    In addition, LCs standards for revised authority files   are unclear: For example, the new geographic name authority is &#274;rakleion   (Greece), in place of the older authority H&#275;rakleion (Greece) and selected over   the more appropriate modern Greek spelling &#274;rakleio. Yet, LC retained the h in   the authority record for D&#275;motik&#275; Pinakoth&#275;k&#275; H&#275;rakleiou, because the usage in   this 1994 resource is clearly noted as polytonic. <BR>
    <BR>
    In a time when library   professionals and resources are stretched thin and when researchers struggle to   navigate an already complex digital world, the LC mandate is imprudent. Not only   was there no communication with the community of Hellenic studies librarians and   scholars when LC approved the change in the tables in December 2009, but the   change is disruptive, confusing, and expensive to implement, with no added value   to researchers. <BR>
    <BR>
    While many agree that the current system of adding the   "h" for the rough breathing mark may be an out-dated practice, it is a   convention that librarians and scholars have learned to work with and are   comfortable using. There is a finite group of words that require the rough   breathing: http://www.polytoniko.org/kano.php#dasunomenes. One solution that   would be easier to implement is that a similar list could be included as an   addendum to the existing table to help new catalogers and users determine when   the h should be added. During recent discussions in the Hellenic studies   librarian community, a number of other solutions have been proposed, which   should also be given due consideration. <BR>
    <BR>
    As those most affected by the LC   mandate, we strongly recommend that LCs new transliteration standards for modern   Greek publications be tabled indefinitely, pending further discussions and   analysis in the Hellenic studies library community and until such a time that   there are funding and resources for the planning and implementation of any   national retrospective conversion projects. <BR>
