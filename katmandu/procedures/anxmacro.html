  <h5><b>Using the annexing macros in the "voymacs" file</b> <br>
    <b>(7/19/01)</b> </h5>
  <p>The "voymacs" file has general use macros for sending items to both Annex 
    A and Annex B.&nbsp; There are other files with macros to assist with specific 
    large-scale transferring projects.&nbsp; If you have a need for customized 
    transferring macros, consult Joyce Bell to see what macros are already available. 
  <p>&nbsp;<b>Technical Services and Rare Books staff:</b> <br>
    Use of these macros does NOT automatically create statistical entries, the 
    online form should be filled out with a total count of the number of pieces 
    annexed. The form is available at: http://libweb5.princeton.edu/pres/nine.asp. 
  <p><b>How to activate the macros:</b> <br>
    Any of the macros can be accessed from the annexing menu with Ctrl + Sh +a 
  <p>The macros also have individual activation keys: <br>
    &nbsp;win+n ANXA, no items <br>
    &nbsp;win+a ANXA, 1 item <br>
    &nbsp;win+i ANXA, more than 1 item <br>
    &nbsp;win+p ANXA, from item, only fixes item 
  <p>&nbsp;win+k ANXB, no items <br>
    &nbsp;win+h ANXB, 1 item <br>
    &nbsp;win+j ANXB, more than one item <br>
    &nbsp;win+l ANXB, from item, only fixes item 
  <p><b>How to use the macros:</b> <br>
    The "no items", "1 item" and ">1 item" macros all start with the MFHD.&nbsp; 
    With the MFHD record open, either click anywhere in the 852 field, or make 
    sure the pointer is in that field then activate the macro.&nbsp; The "only 
    fixes item" starts from an item record and it meant to be used in conjunction 
    with the ">1 item" macro as described below. 
  <p>"no items" will fix and save the MFHD and create a new item record.&nbsp; 
    You will scan in the barcode and save and close the item record and close 
    the MFHD. <br>
    &nbsp; (your preferences must be set for the proper item type default) 
  <p>"1 item" will fix and save the MFHD, open, fix and save the item record, 
    then close both records. 
  <p>">1 item" will fix and save the MFHD and open all (or most) of the item records 
    <br>
    &nbsp; (use this macro first then use the "only fixes item" macro on each 
    item record) 
  <p>"only fixes item" will adjust the location and item type and save and close 
    the item record. <br>
    (use this macro after using the ">1 item" macro--keep using it until all the 
    items are fixed) <br>
