<P>
<B>Do not attempt to do this procedure without proper training. Contact
Maryann Langer, Catalog Unit V, 8-2309 to schedule a training
session.</B>
<P>
<B>NOTE: </B>Before any annexing work is done, the
Annex Notification form should have been submitted and approved.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> Serial volumes may not be duplicated in
an annex and a location. If what you want to send to the annexes is also
held in another location, you may not annex it. No more than one copy of
a bookset may be located in the annexes, (see
<A HREF="http://infoshare1.princeton.edu/katmandu/loc/annpol.html">Revised
Annex Policy</A>, Addendum to Library Council Summary, 7/29/1993) If there
is already a copy in either annex, you must either keep the item(s) or send
them to Cataloging Unit V for withdrawal or further inspection,.
<P>
<B>NOTE: </B>Each volume being annexed must have an
item record in Voyager. If not, add item record(s) to Annex mfhd as per step
7 in this procedure.
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Log onto Voyager cataloging module.
    <P>
  <LI>
    Call up the record. Examine the bibliographic record to verify title
    -- what you are sending must match bibliographic information as listed in
    the Voyager record. Be aware of title changes.
    <P>
     NOTE: It is helpful to use the "<B>Show associated records</B>" icon
    to display the bibliographic tree and see the holdings record(s) and item
    record(s) that are linked to the bibliographic record.
    <P>
     To edit a field: Use the usual Windows cut/copy/paste and overwrite
    capabilities. <BR>
    To add a field: <BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Use the F3 function key to add a line above the selected line
    <BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Use the F4 function key to add a line below the selected line
    <BR>

  <LI>
    Display the holdings record for your location and the annex by clicking
    on the "<B>Strapped books</B>" icon.
    <P>
  <LI>
    Update the <B>866</B> field for both the original location and the
    annex. Change only the numbers, NOT the designators. If any LACKS notes pertain
    to the volumes being annexed, remove them from the original location and
    add them to annex location. If you are unsure or have questions about the
    866 fields, contact Catalog Unit IV. See example below. <BR>
    OR <BR>
    If you don't wish to update the holdings yourself: Make printouts of the
    holdings records for both the original location and the annex. Write on the
    printouts the changes in holdings for both locations. Write a note at top
    of uppermost printout "Please update Voyager", and send to Catalog Unit IV
    when remaining steps of the procedure have been completed.
