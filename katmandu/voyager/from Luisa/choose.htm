<P>
<SMALL>Most serials are cataloged under title, but some are entered under
a personal (100), corporate (110), or conference (111) main entry. If the
catalog record has a 1xx field, the entry in this field should appear on
the piece in hand. It need not match exactly; sometimes it will appear in
a different language or in some other variant form.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>If adding from a bookcard, the author main entry will appear first,
and the title below it, indented slightly. Again, the exact form of the name
may vary.</SMALL>
<P>
<B><SMALL>2. <U>Matching the title </U></SMALL></B>
<P>
<SMALL>Generally, the title on the title page of the piece should match,
word for word, the 245 field, subfield a (and subfields n and/or p, if present).
Many serials do not have a title page, in which case the title is instead
taken from the cover. Slight variations in title may be accounted for in
notes in the 246 or 500 fields. </SMALL>

<SMALL>For the purpose of title matching, 245 subfields b and c, if present,
can be ignored.</SMALL>

<SMALL>If adding from a bookcard/form without piece in hand, the title may
not match exactly. Check the call no. and number/date information
carefully.</SMALL>
<P>
<U><SMALL>NOTE ABOUT IDENTICAL TITLES:</SMALL></U>
<P>
<SMALL>If two serials cataloged under title main entry have identical titles
as well as identical call nos., it means that the title has changed and then
later changed back. At least one of the records will have a 130 Uniform Title
Heading field with a parenthetical qualifier following the title. The qualifier
will contain a year indicating when the title began. Choose the correct record
by examining the dates on both records, and seeing where your volume fits
in.</SMALL>

<P>
<SMALL>For a serial volume to be added to a Voyager record, it must fall
within the range of numbers/dates given in the 362 and 008 date fields.</SMALL>
<P>
<U><SMALL>362 field:</SMALL></U><SMALL> The first and last volumes of a serial,
if known, are recorded in the 362 field. The 362 may include both numerical
and chronological designations (but not publication dates, which are given
in the 260 field, subfield c). If the serial is still open, only the beginning
number/date is given. Uncertain or inexact information may be given in an
unformatted note. If the beginning and ending information is unknown, the
field is omitted.</SMALL>
<P>
<U><SMALL>008 field: </SMALL></U><SMALL>The beginning and ending dates (years
only) are also recorded in the fixed fields 008 Date 1 and Date 2. For open
serials, the ending year is given as 9999. If part of the date is uncertain,
the unknown digits are represented by u's. For serials lacking a chronological
designation, the publication dates are given.</SMALL>

<SMALL>NOTE: Do not add serial volumes to interim records (identified by
599 field THIS IS AN INTERIM CATALOG ENTRY THAT MAY BE INACCURATE OR INCOMPLETE);
look instead for a full catalog record.</SMALL>
<P>
<SMALL>NOTE: If searching by Journal title, Dates 1 and 2 will be displayed
as part of the search results. If searching by call no., only the beginning
date (Date 1) is displayed. The dates may be useful in selecting the current
record.</SMALL>

volume matches the record, call Catalog Unit IV.</B></SMALL>
