<h5> <b>Adding Holdings and Item records to Voyager for Serials <br>
  </b></h5>

  ANY questions regarding this procedure, call Catalog Unit IV.</font></B><font color="#0000FF" size="1">

<P>
This procedure would be used for items that have a bibliographic record
in Voyager, but the holdings record (location, copy) and/or item record (barcode)
is missing. Item records are generally only created for bound holdings, not
for individual unbound issues.
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Log onto Voyager cataloging module.
    <P>
  <LI>
    Call up the record. The most efficient search for this procedure is
    by call number.
    <P>
     If you don't find a match, check with your supervisor. If a bibliographic
    record really doesn't exist, create a circ-on-the-fly record, which will
    consist of a bib, mfhd and item. See the
    <A HREF="CreateforCircResLocal.html">Creating records for circulation, reserves
    and local cataloging </A>procedure.
    <P>
     If two or more matches are found, choose the correct record by matching
    up the title exactly and checking other bibliographic information if
    necessary.
    <P>
     INFORMATION ABOUT <A HREF="choose.html">CHOOSING A CORRECT
    MATCH</A>
    <P>
  <LI>
    Display the bibliographic record if not already displayed by default.
    Verify that the record is the correct one, by checking title (245 field),
    numbers and dates (362 and 008 fields).
    <P>
     INFORMATION ABOUT <A HREF="choose.html">VERIFYING THE CORRECT
    MATCH</A>
    <P>
     Accept the bibliographic record as is. Do not make any corrections
    to a record. For problems, contact Cataloging Unit 4.
    <P>
  <LI>
    Click on the "<B>Show associated records</B>" icon to display the
    bibliographic tree. Examine the holdings and item records. Check to see if
    your item already exists.
    <P>
     If there already exist a holdings record with a location and copy
    number which matches yours, but without an item record (barcode), you will
    need to examine the holdings record for accuracy and create an item
    record.
    <P>
     If there is no location and/or copy number which matches yours you
    will need to create a holdings record and an item record.
    <P>
  <LI>
    <B>Adding and displaying a holdings records</B><BR>
     There should be a holdings record for each copy that the library
    own. E.g. One holdings record for (sg) copy 1 and one holdings record for
    (sg) copy 2.
    <P>
  <LI>
    Click on the "<B>Strapped Books</B>" icon to display a holdings record.
    Examine it for accuracy according to the guidelines listed below.
    <P>
  <LI>
    Click on the "<B>Strapped Books +</B>" icon to create a holdings record.
    The holdings record (mfhd) template will display. Follow the guidelines for
    entering information below. You must fill in the 852 field (location, call
    number) and add <B>866</B> fields (summary holdings, notes)
    <P>
     To edit a field: Use the usual Windows cut/copy/paste and overwrite
    capabilities. <BR>
    To add a field: <BR>
    Use the F3 function key to add a line above the selected line <BR>
    Use the F4 function key to add a line below the selected line <BR>
    To delete a field, select the field and hit the delete key. <BR>
    To insert a delimiter symbol use the F9 function key
    <P>
  <LI>
    <B>When creating a holdings record for a serial you must change the
    "Type of Record" in the fixed fields part of the holdings
    record</B>.

	<P>
      <LI>
	If there is some slight discrepancy in the holdings (e.g., a volume
	listed as lacking which the library does have), update the holdings note
	accordingly. Holdings statements should not be substantially altered, as
	they have been set up by Cataloging staff to follow AACR2 form. Vernacular
	designators and vernacular months/seasons should be used, as they appear
	on the piece or abbreviated according to AACR2 Appendix B. Any major discrepancy
	in holdings information should be investigated further before any attempt
	is made to update the record.
	<P>
    </UL>
  <LI>
    <U>If you have added a new holdings record for your location/copy
    </U>you must add the appropriate 866 fields. These fields
    stores copy-specific summary holdings and other notes for multi-part
    publications.
    <P>
  <LI>
    Retrieve the holdings record of a previously added copy. Copy the
    866 fields and paste them into your newly created holdings record. Update
    the 866 &Oslash;a to reflect the specific holdings for your copy, but do
    not change the basic form of the holdings statement. Delete information that
    does not apply to your copy. Do not delete or change the 866 &Oslash;x
    DESIGNATOR: field. (SEE ABOVE FOR EXAMPLES AND BELOW FOR THINGS TO KEEP IN
    MIND)
    <P>
     NOTE ABOUT COPY 2's, 3's, etc.:<BR>
    First, make sure that a new holdings record is really called for. Under long-ago
    Library policies, some volumes added as c. 2 were actually replacements for
    missing volumes. These are now considered as belonging to c. 1, and the items
    should simply be added to the existing copy. Make sure the copy number is
    given in &Oslash; t of the 852.
    <P>
     If adding holdings for a Copy 2, begin the Summary of Bound Holdings
    statement with the words "COPY 2:" and add ", c.2" after the
    designator:

    <B>boat </B>icon.
    <P>
  <LI>
     <B>IMPORTANT: </B><BR>
    Do not include unbound issues.
    <P>
     Do not add to the beginning or end of a holdings run without checking
    the bibliographic record to make sure that these holdings do not belong to
    an earlier/later title record.
    <P>
     Do not use a publication date as a chronological designation. If
    the only date given on the piece is a date of publication or copyright, use
    the phrase (published in &#133;) in the holdings statement.
    <P>
     Do not add copy 2 holdings to the 866 field for copy 1; there should
    be a separate holdings record for each additional copy.
    <P>
     Do not add earlier volumes if the record indicates CURRENT VOLUME
    ONLY RETAINED
    <P>
     Do not give specific holdings if the 866 0 &Oslash;a says CURRENT
    VOLUME or NEXT-TO-CURRENT VOLUME; in these cases, the specific holdings are
    kept on the MFHD for the permanent location.
    <P>
     Take special care in adding volumes for serials that have more than
    one system of numbering, either concurrent or sequential. It may be useful
    to check the 362 and 515 fields on the bibliographic record and any &Oslash;x
    notes in the 866 field on the holdings record.
    <P>
     Do not add a LACKS note without checking the bibliographic record
    to make sure the absence of the piece has not already been accounted for
    in a 515 Numbering Peculiarities note (e.g., 515 &Oslash;a Vol. for 1979
    never published).
    <P>
     Do not add a LACKS note for a volume that is temporarily
    missing.
    <P>
     Do not include supplement holdings. If adding an item record for
    a supplement, always verify that it is being added to the correct record
    (i.e., check that there is a 525 Supplements note on the bibliographic record,
    and no 866 0 &Oslash; z indicating separate cataloging).
    <P>
     Do not include annual indexes.
    <P>
     Cumulative indexes--NEW:
    <P>
     Two former policies regarding cumulative index holdings have been
    changed. They will now be noted for single- as well as multi- location titles,
    and they will now be noted in a separate field, coded 868.
    <P>
     If adding an item record for a cumulative index, first verify that
    it is listed in a 555 field on the bibliographic record. (If not found, please
    consult Cat. Unit 4.) Then check the holdings record:
    <P>
  <LI>
    If there is already an 868 field listing the index, go on to the item
    record procedure
    <P>
  <LI>
    If the index is listed at the end of the 866 Summary of Bound Holdings
    statement, add an 868 field (first indicator blank, second indicator zero)
    and move the index holdings into it (in subfield a). This can most easily
    be done using Cut and Paste.

    explained below.
    <P>
     Primary adding element = the designation that has been chosen as
    the primary way of identifying individual volumes of a serial. It may be
    numerical, chronological, or a combination of both. It must be sufficient,
    without depending on the secondary, to distinguish each bound volume of a
    serial from all others. For currently added serials, vernacular designators
    are always used, but in older volumes, the abbreviations v. and no. may be
    found instead. The current form of the primary adding element for a serial
    title is documented on the holdings record, in the field 866 0 &Oslash;x

     Secondary adding element = additional designation information that
    may be useful in identifying individual volumes of a serial. Some titles
    have only one system of designation, and therefore no secondary. If the primary
    is numerical, the secondary is always the year or date if present (as a
    chronological designation-publication dates are not used in adding). If the
    primary is chronological, the form of the secondary would be indicated
