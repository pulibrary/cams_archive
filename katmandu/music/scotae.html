	<h2>Title Added Entries</h2>

We will follow LC in making title added entries.  This means also making a title added entry omitting the number when a title begins with a number, unless the title would not be traced at all, e.g., titles consisting solely of the name of one type of composition (MCB 13.1).<p>

(As we do for books, we will continue not to make added entries substituting Arabic numerals for Roman numberals per R.I. 21.30J(9).  We will suppress these added entries on original cataloging done to standard).<p>

Titles consisting solely of the name of one type of composition (i.e. those falling under rule 25.27B) will generally not be traced.<p>

Added entries will not be made for parallel titles that are not truly such.  (E.g. Variationen with the rest of the title in German and English).<p>
