<h2>Scores With Parts</h2>

	Musical scores accompanied by parts should be cataloged according to AACR2 chapter 	5.  Add a local 590 note to the record:  Parts in pocket.<p>
	
	Write the call number for the item on each of the parts, if possible on the fron near the 	top.<p>

	Add a conservation advice slip requesting the bindery to make a pocket for the parts.  	Insert the parts at the back of the score in such a way that they will be noticed by the 	bindery.<p>
