Assigning Accession Numbers to Recordings of<br> Folk or Non-Western Art Music</font></i></center><p>
<i>See also:</i> <a href="./receth.html">Countries List for Folk and non-Western Art Music Recordings</a><p>

Recordings of folk or non-Western art music are classified separately from the general MLIS recordings collection.<p>

An additional prefix derived from <i>Murdock's Outline of World Cultures</i> ((Film B) GN345.3.M87 1983) is interposed between the prefix representing format (LS, CD, VCASS, etc.) and the accession number proper.<p>

This prefix consists of the letter W followed by the appropriate two letters from Murdock which designate the country or people covered (Murdock's additional numbers are not used).<p>

<b>Examples:</b><p>

<b>CD-WAB-1</b>  Gagaku : Japanese court music    (Music--Japan)<p>

<b>LS-WEC-2</b>  Hungarian folk music.  Series 3   (Folk music--Hungary)<p>

<b>CASS-WFO-2</b>  Papa Wemba : Papa Wemba   (Popular music--Zaire)<p> 

Anthologies of folk music from a larger geographical area, as well as recordings of popular music, jazz and folk music of the United States other than Native American / American Indian music, are assigned to the regular range.<p>
