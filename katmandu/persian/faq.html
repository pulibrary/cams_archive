<b><i><font color=green>Question:</font></b></i><pre><i>I would like to suggest that we devote some time to discussing
romanization.  Because the LC table is not very felicitous for
transliterating Persian, we get a variety of spellings for the same word.
In OCLC, this means lots of records for the same book.  I would be happy to
supply lots of examples.

I also have a question about using the prime mark to separate two letters
-- why is it used between two letters that would never be joined together
anyway?  For example, any word beginning with bar.  Is it to show the word
is a compound?  And why?</i>
</pre>
<b><i><font color=red>Answer:</font></b></i><br>
Persian romanization is problematic. One major problem I see is "Persian correct 
spelling versus LC romanization" This might explain some of the problems. The examples 
will help to limit our discussion to certain issues.<br>
Your question about  using or not using prime mark with "Bar" is valid. There is no need 
for it. I would ignore this rule. Bar is a proposition. Does not come alone. Has to be 
attached to following word and R is consonant. For example: "Bar" and "Rasi" which is 
spelled Barrasi. There is no need for prime mark.Some catalogers in general use Barrasi 
with prime mark because they consider "Bar" and "Rasi"  combination as a compound word. 
I think we can be more specific in this case.<hr>
