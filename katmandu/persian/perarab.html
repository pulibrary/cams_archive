Determining Persian form vs. Arabic Form</i></h3>
<hr>

Search the name as it appears on the item, as well as in an Arabized

or Persianized form for LC in RLIN and in the NAF.  If it is not

established in either form, establish it as follows:

<p>
<table><tr><td valign=top>

<b>

      Classical names:</b></td><td>   Follow the guidelines for establishing the name

from                    reference sources as you would any Arabic classical name,

and make appropriate references from the forms found                    on

the item.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top>



  <b>    Modern names:</b></td><td>        If the name appears somewhere on the item in

Persian, it may be established from the Persian form                    if

appropriate (i.e., if there is evidence that the

person writes primarily in Persian or if the book is

about a Persian person).  If the name only appears                      in

a romanized form, it must be established as it                  appears*.

In this case, an arbitrary reference may                        be made

from what the most likely Persian form would                    be.



    <br> <i>[*Unless the name is significant enough to be found in modern

reference      sources in either English or Persian (i.e., <i>Who's who in

Iran</i>, etc.).       The heading and dates from the reference source may be

used.]</i>
