Dates for Classical Authors </i></h3>
<hr>





   Examples of many situations and treatments can be found in the NAF.

A few rules seem to define current LC practice, as deduced from

communications to us.

<ol>

   <li> If the piece in hand or reference source gives only Miladi dates,

transcribe the years as given.



   <li> Unless day and/or month are cited, whether in the piece in

hand or in an outside reference source, a Hijri year is always         to

be transcribed in a heading as a choice of two Miladi years

connected by "or" (except when a Hijri year falls entirely

within one Miladi year).  This practice is to be followed even         if

the piece in hand or reference source provides the Hijri            date

with a "corresponding" single Miladi date, as LC

considers such correspondences, unless accompanied by days

and/or months, to be mere "guesses."



   <li> If the piece in hand and a reference source disagree on an

author's dates, consult a third source (i.e., a second reference

source) if available.  If no third source can be found, or if the

information from the third source does not "break the tie," cite       all

three sources and give the dates in the heading in a       compromising

form, using "?," "ca.," "fl.," "Xth cent." and       Xth/Yth cent." as

outlined in 22.17.  A single "fl." year given       by a reference source

does not justify the use of any date in the       heading, unless to

resolve a conflict with another heading.
</ol>
