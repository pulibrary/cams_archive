Choice of Additional Elements in the Name </i></h3>
<hr>




   Add to the ism and father-patronymic if any available.  Per 22.22C1,

if the entry element is not the ism or a patronymic derived from the

father, include these in the heading "unless they are not    customarily

used in the name by which the person is known" (i.e.,    unless his name

is well-known and short like that of Hafiz, Sadi,    etc.) [disregard

example in 22.22].

   <i>"Include an additional name, descriptive epithet, or term of honour

that is treated as part of the name if it aids in identifying the

individual"</i> (22.22C1).<p>

 LC practice is to add additional names very

seldom, apparently in accordance with the statement in 22.22C1,

<i>

"Generally omit other elements of the name, particularly patronymics

derived from anyone other than the father."</i><p>
