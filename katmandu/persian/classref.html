References for Classical Authors </i></h3>
<hr>



   Per 22.22B1, "refer from any part of the name not used as entry

element if there is reason to believe that the person's name may be

sought under that part."  LC seldom makes such references.  Only    three

types are (almost) always made:

<ol>

   <li>  Refer from the heading for a classical author in direct order,

not including elements which do not appear in the heading even        if

they are found in the piece in hand (i.e., they do not        necessarily

refer from the form in the piece in hand, though        this is cited in

full in a 670).



   <li>  If the heading consists solely of ism and patronymic, refer from

the patronymic.



   <li>  Refer from non-standard romanizations found in the piece at

hand, choosing the entry element for the reference (if possible)        to

correspond with the entry element in the heading.  Do not        make

direct or other references from non-standard romanizations.</ol>



   If you refer from elements of the name other than those discussed in

1 or 2 above, do not change the order of these elements from that in

which they appear in the source where you found them.
