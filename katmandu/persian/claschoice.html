<h3><i>
Choice of Entry for Classical Authors </i></h3>
<hr>



   The choices of entry element for Persian classical authors remain the

same as for Arabic classical authors.  The main entry element may be any

of the various elements of a name -- khitab, kunyah, ism, patronymic,

laqab, or nisbah.  "Determine this from reference sources" (22.22B1). If

the author is very well known or if the classical person is not an

author, reference sources such as the Encyclopaedia Iranica,

Encyclopaedia of Islam, Encyclopaedia Britannica may be consulted and

their data (dates, etc.) quoted in headings as they appear.  In general,

consult at least one reference source aside from the piece in hand as

follows:

<ol type=a>

     <li> If the author is found in Fihrist-i mustanad, choose the

element(s)         in the entry-heading as the main heading entry element.



     <li> If the author is not found in Fihrist-i mustanad, consult Storey

or      any other reference source.  If the author is not found in any

other   reference source than Fihrist-i mustanad, use the entry element(s)

as found and provide references as appropriate.



     <li> If the author is not found in any reference sources, choose as the

main heading entry element a surname in the following order:

<ol>

        <li> Takhallus.

        <li> Phrases marked ma'ruf bih, mashhur bih, etc.

        <li> Any unusual surname (not derived from a place name or madhhab).

        <li> A surname derived from a place name (Isfahani).

        <li> A surname derived from a madhab (Shafii)</ol>

        

     <li> If there are no surname elements present, enter under the ism and

father-patronymic in direct order. <ul> <b><font color=red>Note:</font></b> In citing a second or

third reference source, quote the name in full.</ul></ol>
