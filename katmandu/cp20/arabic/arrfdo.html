<h3>Direct order references</h3></center>

	Direct order references are used for <b>CLASSICAL</b> authors only.  A reference is made beginning with the ism and containing all elements (and only those elements) found in the heading.<p>
Do not include elements which do not appear in the heading even if they are found in the piece in hand (i.e., do not necessarily refer from the form found in the chief source even though this is cited in full in a 670).
