<h3>Choice of entry element for classical authors</h3></center>

The entry element may be any of the various elements of a name--<i>khitab, kunyah, ism, patronymic, laqab</i> or <i>nisbah</i>.  "Determine this from reference sources" (22.22B1), keeping in mind that the piece in hand is a reference source, though a low-ranking one as regards choice of entry element.<p>

If the author is very well-known, or if the classical person is not an author, reference sources such as the <i>Encyclopedia of Islam</i>, <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, etc. may be consulted and their data (dates, etc.) quoted in headings as they appear.  In general, <b>consult at least one</b> reference source aside from the piece in hand as follows:<p>
<ul>
<li>If the author is found in <b>Zirikli</b>, choose the element(s) in the entry-heading as the entry element.  (note: if forename surname is given, enter under surname and add forename and father-patronymic as usual)<p>

<li>If the author is not found in Zirikli, consult <b>Brockelmann</b> or <b>Kahhalah</b>.  If the author is found in Brockelmann, choose the italicized element(s) as the entry element.  If Kahhalah's entry/heading contains an element which is not a forename, use this as the entry element (i.e., Haymi in the heading Muhammad al-Haymi).<p>
<ul>
<li>	If the elements in <b>Kahhalah</b>'s entry/heading are all forenames, choose the element(s) in Kahhalah's article or in the piece in hand designated by a phrase such as "al-shahir bi-" or "al-maruf bi-" for the entry element if such a phrase occurs.<p>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>	If the author is not found in Zirikli or Brockelmann, and if no element is so designated in Kahhalah or in the piece in hand, use as the entry element the briefest element(s) employed to designate the author in the preface or text of the piece in hand.<p>
</ul>

<li>If the author is not found in any of these sources, choose as the entry element a surname in this order:
<ul>
<li>any <b>unusual</b> surname (i.e., not derived froma place-name or a madhhab)
</ul>
<ul>
<li>a surname derived from a <b>place-name</b> (i.e., Baghdadi)
</ul>
<ul>
<li>a surname derived from a <b>madhhab</b> (i.e., Hanafi)
</ul>

If there are no surnames, choose the element(s) following the ism and father-patronymic, if any (i.e. Ibn al-Lamish in Ahmad ibn Ali ibn al-Lamish).  If there are no such elements, enter the ism and father-patronymic in direct order.
</ul>

NOTE:  In cases where the Zirikli entry element seems inappropriate or inaccurate, catalogers may consult a second reference source.  If the latter gives a more appropriate heading, use it in constructing the heading and cite both sources.
