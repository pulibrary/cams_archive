<h3>Dates from book in hand</h3></center>
	
	Dates from the item being cataloged are always <b>transcribed</b> in the 670.  If both Hijri and Miladi dates are given, give both.<p>

	Unless day and/or month are given, whether in the piece in hand or in an outside reference source, a Hijri year is always to be transcribed in a heading as a choice of <b>two Miladi years</b> connected by "or" (except when a Hijri year falls entirely within one Miladi year).  This practice is to be followed even if the piece in hand or reference source provides the Hijri date with a "corresponding" single Miladi date.<p>

	If the piece in hand and a reference source <b>disagree</b> on an author's dates, consult a <b>third</b> source (i.e., a second reference source) if available.  If no third source can be found, or if the information from the third source does not "break the tie," cite all three sources and give the dates in the heading in a compromising form, using "?," "ca.," "xth cent.," etc. as outlined in 22.17.<p>
  Note: fl. is usually used with a <b>span of dates</b>--a single year given in an Arabic reference source does not justify the use of a single flourished date in the heading.
