<h3>How to establish a modern author</h3></center>

	Modern authors are assumed to have surnames (22.22A1), and should be entered under the surname.  If they have no obvious surname, then the "element that identifies the individual and functions as a surname" should be chosen for the entry element.  This is (generally) taken to be the last element in the title page form of the name.<p>
  A surname-like element other than the last appearing on the t.p. may be chosen as the entry element if there is compelling evidence that it functions as the author's surname.  (Typography, layout, and/or consistent usage may be considered compelling evidence.)<p>
Once the entry element has been determined, include as forename elements all other elements of the name as they appear on the t.p., including kunyahs and patronymics other than the father's.  Do not, however, include any surname elements after the one chosen for the entry element.
