<h3>What is a Modern Author?</h3></center>

	Modern authors are those active in the 20th century (22.22A1).  Our rule of thumb is to treat  authors living during any part of the 20th century as modern.<p>
  Authors whose life spanned both the 19th and 20th centuries may be treated as classical if it can be determined that they were primarily active during the 19th century.
