<h3>Copy: <i>Variant Edition Cataloging</i></h3><hr>
<b>Variant Edition Cataloging</b> (<b><font color=red>cre *</font></b>) is generally the same as with <b>matching copy</b>, with some exceptions. The <b>fixed fields</b> will always have to be filled in.
<p>There will be situations where the <b>variant edition copy</b> will contain data which is pertinent only to the <b>specific edition</b> of the work it represents, and is <b>not relevant</b> to the edition represented by the card.
<p>Conversely, essential data represented on the card <b>may not be present</b> on the copy.
<p>Make the proper adjustments to the <b>variant edition copy</b> and make sure the copy contains no extraneous bibliographic information <b>irrelevant</b> or <b>inappropriate</b> to the work represented by the card in hand.
<p> Be careful particularly of the <b>following fixed fields</b>: <b>PC, PD</b> and the <b>following  variable fields</b>: <b>240, 260, 300</b>.
