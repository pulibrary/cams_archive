      <h5>Annexing Policy</h5>
      <center>
      </center>
      Policy of January 16, 1992<br>
      Revised October 8, 1992<br>
      <i>Revised July 29, 1993</i>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li> Department Heads establish the priorities of annexing request both 
          in their own Deparments, and in consultation with each other. Likewise, 
          Department Heads also approve requests for transfer of items out of 
          the Annexes. Use the following forms. <i>[You must have Adobe Acrobat 
          installed]</i>
          <ul>
            <b><a href="http://infoshare1.princeton.edu:2003/notis/annex.pdf">Annex 
            Notification Form</a> <br>
            <a href="http://infoshare1.princeton.edu:2003/notis/deanx.pdf">Deannex 
            Notification Form</a></b>
          </ul>
          <p> 
        <li><i>Duplicate copies of serial titles may not be housed in the Annexes 
          (considered collectively as a single unit). a serial title which is 
          held in any other campus library is not a candidate for transfer to 
          the Annexes. Furthermore, serial runs currently located in the Annexes 
          which duplicate titles held elsewhere in the library system will not 
          be retained. Collection managers are always at liberty to compose a 
          more complete serial run from the holdings of several libraries, retaining 
          those volumes in the best condition, and locate such a title in either 
          Annex. Exceptions to this policy will be considered when the format 
          of the copies in question is different (e.g., microform and print), 
          or when other special circumstances apply, such as the duplicate copy 
          being a rare item.
          <p> Duplicate copies of monographs are candidates for transfer to the 
            Annexes. However, no more than one copy of any given title may be 
            located in the Annexes.
          </i>
          <p> 
        <li>Council affirmed the concept of the Annexes as a distinct location, 
          as opposed to a remote extension of each of the various individual special 
          collections. It was recognized that individual special collection policies, 
          such as those governing circulation of materials, no longer apply to 
          such materials once they are transferred to the Annexes. 
          <p> 
        <li>Locally created and controlled collections, including any item or 
          group of materials which are uncataloged, will not be accepted for storage 
          in the Annex. The Annexes must no longer be thought of as warehouses, 
          but as a circulating collection of little-used materials, or materials 
          located there for their protection.
          <p> 
        <li>Council has endorsed the concept of choosing Annex as the holding 
          location at the point of selection, where feasible and appropriate, 
          recognizing that annexing transfer decisions, and the resultant technical 
          processing, require a significant time investment for the library.
