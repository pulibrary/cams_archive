<h3>Ezra/Nehemiah</h3>
<font size=-1>
<i>"The book of Ezra, like its
companion Nehemiah, is named after the principal person mentioned in its
pages. The two books are counted as one in the Talmud, in Josephus, and
in the Canon of Melito (A.D. 171), and are so treated in subscription of
the MT [i.e. Masoretic Text]. In the LXX [i.e. Septuagint] Ezra-Nehemiah
is called Ezra B [i.e. 2.], while an apocryphal book of Ezra is called
Ezra A [i.e. 1.]. The apocryphal Greek Ezra is usually in English
versions called 2 Esdras or 3 Ezra following the Vulgate, which counts
Ezra and Nehemiah as 1 and 2 Ezra. A later apocalyptic book is
denominated 4 Ezra." <u>The international standard Bible
encyclopedia</u>, "Ezra, Book of" (Grand Rapids, Mich. : Eerdmans,
