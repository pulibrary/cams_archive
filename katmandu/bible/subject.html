<h2>Cataloging Biblical Materials</h2>
<h3><i>Subjects</i></h3>
<hr>
    
There are two basic ways to deal with the Biblical treatment of subject terms. The first regards topics as <i>subject matter in the Bible</i>, i.e. How is
the particular subject treated in the Bible? What does the Bible have to say about a given subject? When that is the case, use the heading
<b><tt>[Subject] in the Bible.</tt></b><br>
Examples:<br>
<tt>Intercession in the Bible<br>
Altars in the Bible<br>
Knowledge, Theory of, in the Bible</tt>
<br>
These headings are established subjects in their own right, and the topics that are the basis of these headings must themselves be
established subject headings.
<p>
The second method deals with <i>established topical headings</i> that are theological and/or ethical in nature. The pattern to be followed is:
<b><tt>[Topic]&#135;xBiblical teaching.</tt></b><br>
Examples:<br>
<tt>Obedience&#135;xBiblical teaching<br>
Sunday&#135;xBiblical teaching<br>
Wealth&#135;xBiblical teaching</tt>
