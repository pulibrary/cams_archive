<h2>Cataloging Biblical Materials</h2>
<h3><i>Psalters</i></h3>
<hr>
    
In many instances the uniform title of a Psalter is qualified by the <i>authorized form of a manuscript</i>. This is because most published editions of the Psalter
are facsimiles of medieval manuscripts. <p>The current liturgy of the Catholic Church does not have the Psalter per se, rather these manuscripts
were produced when the Psalter was a separate book. <p> When a facsimile of a Psalter is published, the cataloger must determine whether the
<b>intention of the publication</b> is to present a <i>liturgical text</i> or a <i>work of art</i>. If the Psalter being cataloged is already in the NAF, look for a note
such as the following:<blockquote><tt>Heading [for Psalter as a liturgical book] represents the textual content of ms.; for ms. as a physical entity,
including its decoration, use ... [uniform title for ms.].</tt></blockquote> Such a note would only be given when both the liturgical text and the manuscript
(or facsimile) are <tt>130 0</tt> headings in the NAF, in which case each would be a <tt>530 0</tt> for the other. <p> When that is not the case, you
need to determine whether the item in hand is published as a liturgical text or work of art.<ul> <li>One helpful hint is to look at the subtitle (if there is
one). If it gives liturgical details, it is a liturgical text and would have the Church as the main entry.</ul>
