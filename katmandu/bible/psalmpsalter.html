<h3><i>Differentiating Psalms from Psalters</i></h3>
<hr>
    
Important distinctions must be made regarding Psalters. They are distinct, bibliographically, from the Biblical Book of Psalms. They are considered either as a liturgical book or as a work of art. It depends on the nature of the publication in hand.</p> 
<p>
<i>The Book of Psalms</i> as a Biblical book would simply contain the text of the Psalms (or of a selection), and its purpose would be to provide the
sacred text for reading. The Psalms themselves in the Bible are inherently liturgical texts, and they contain brief directions. Nevertheless, the
purpose of the edition in hand would be to provide only the Biblical text. In this case use the heading:
<tt>Bible.&#135;pO.T.&#135;pPsalms...</tt>
<p>
<em>Psalters</em>, on the other hand, are <em>liturgical books</em> arranged for liturgical worship in Christian churches. They contain
Christian liturgical directions, and are intended for use in churches, monasteries, etc. The text is the Biblical text, <b>but the arrangement
is liturgical</b>.<blockquote> <em>"Enter the work under the heading for the church as a liturgical text if it contains any obvious liturgical element (as
when one or more of the following are added to the psalms: canticles, antiphons, liturgical calendar, etc.)."</em><b> (RI21.39)</b></blockquote>
 In these
cases, <b>AACR2 21.39A1</b> states that a liturgical work should be entered under the heading for the <em>"church or denominational
body to which it pertains."</em> These headings are usually accompanied by a qualifier that further identifies them.<p>
