<h2 align="center">CATALOGING BIBLICAL MATERIALS</h2>
<p>
This document is meant to serve as an aide for various aspects of cataloging Bibles and materials related to the Bible. It will illustrate AACR2
rules and clarify some complicated aspects of dealing with Biblical materials. It is also intended to be a compilation of rules and guidelines
that are scattered in various places: AACR2, Rule interpretations, the NAF and SAF, the Subject cataloging manual and the classification
schedules.</p>

<h3><a name="uniftitles">UNIFORM TITLES</a></h3>
<p>
All Biblical headings in the NAF are based on the Authorized Version. According to AACR2 25.18.A3 the "brief citation form of the
Authorized Version" should be used. First, use the heading<b> Bible</b>, followed by one of the main sections of the Bible (<b>O.T.</b>
or<b> N.T.</b>). Next follows the name of the specific relevant book. See the tables in the last section of this document for full lists of the
books of the Bible. Each of these sections is preceded by<b>&#135;p</b>.</p>
<p>
If, as is the case with several books (e.g.  I-II Timothy), there are multiple headings with the same name in sequential order, follow the name of
the specific book by a comma and the relevant ordinal numeral in English: e.g., <b>Bible.&#135;pN.T.&#135;pTimothy, 1st</b>;
<b>Bible.&#135;pN.T.&#135;pTimothy, 2nd</b>.</p> 
<p>
To extend a uniform title to apply to a specific chapter of a Biblical book, add the number of the chapter in Roman numeral(s); and add the
number(s) of specific verses in Arabic numeral(s).<br>
Examples:<br>
<ul type="disc"><li>Bible.&#135;pO.T.&#135;pGenesis XXVIII, 10-XXXII, 3</li>
<li>Bible.&#135;pO.T.&#135;pKings, 1st, XXI</li>
<li>Bible.&#135;pN.T.&#135;pThessalonians, 2nd, II, 1-12</li>    
</ul>
</p>
<p><a href="#contents">Back to CONTENTS</a></p>
<h3><a name="psalms">PSALMS</a></h3>
<p>     
A somewhat unique case involves the Psalms. In order to specify a particular Psalm, use the
pattern:<b>Bible.&#135;pO.T.&#135;pPsalms[space][particular Psalm(s) as Roman numeral(s)]</b><br>
Examples:</p>
<ul type="disc"><li>Bible.&#135;pO.T.&#135;pPsalms CXX</li>
<li>Bible.&#135;pO.T.&#135;pPsalms CXX-CXXXIV</li>
</ul>
<p>N.B.: Even if there is only one Psalm,<em> the uniform title is still in the plural</em>: Bible.&#135;pO.T.&#135;p<em>Psalms</em>...</p>
<p><a href="#contents">Back to CONTENTS</a></p>
<h3><a name="psalters">PSALTERS</a></h3>
<p>
Important distinctions must be made regarding Psalters. They are distinct, bibliographically, from the Biblical Book of Psalms described
above. They are considered either as a liturgical book or as a work of art. It depends on the nature of the publication in hand.</p> 
<p>
The Book of Psalms as a Biblical book would simply contain the text of the Psalms (or of a selection), and its purpose would be to provide the
sacred text for reading. The Psalms themselves in the Bible are inherently liturgical texts, and they contain brief directions. Nevertheless, the
purpose of the edition in hand would be to provide only the Biblical text. In this case use the heading
<b>Bible.&#135;pO.T.&#135;pPsalms</b>...
</p>
<p>
<em>Psalters</em>, on the other hand, are <em>liturgical books</em> arranged for liturgical worship in Christian churches. They contain
Christian liturgical directions, and are intended for use in churches, monasteries, etc. The text is the Biblical text, <b><i>but the arrangement
is liturgical</i></b>. <em>"Enter the work under the heading for the church as a liturgical text if it contains any obvious liturgical element (as
when one or more of the following are added to the psalms: canticles, antiphons, liturgical calendar, etc.)."</em><b> (RI21.39)</b> In these
cases, <b>AACR2 21.39A1</b> states that a liturgical work should be entered under the heading for the <em>"church or denominational
body to which it pertains."</em> These headings are usually accompanied by a qualifier that further identifies them.<br>  
Examples:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Catholic Church.&#135;tPsalter (Ms. Pierpont Morgan Library. G.53)</li>
<li>Catholic Church.&#135;tPsalter (Mainz psalter)</li>
<li>Catholic Church.&#135;tPsalterium monasticum</li>
<li>Orthodox Eastern Church.&#135;tPsaltir§ sléedovannañe</li>
<li>Church of England.&#135;tBook of common prayer.&#135;pPsalter</li>
</ul>
<p>
In many instances the uniform title is qualified by the authorized form of a manuscript. This is because most published editions of the Psalter
are facsimiles of medieval manuscripts. The current liturgy of the Catholic Church does not have the Psalter per se, rather these manuscripts
were produced when the Psalter was a separate book.  When a facsimile of a Psalter is published, the cataloger must determine whether the
intention of the publication is to present a liturgical text or a work of art. If the Psalter being cataloged is already in the NAF, look for a note
such as the following: <b>Heading [for Psalter as a liturgical book] represents the textual content of ms.; for ms. as a physical entity,
including its decoration, use ... [uniform title for ms.].</b> Such a note would only be given when both the liturgical text and the manuscript
(or facsimile) are <i>130 0</i> headings in the NAF, in which case each would be a <i>530 0</i> for the other.  When that is not the case, you
need to determine whether the item in hand is published as a liturgical text or work of art. One helpful hint is to look at the subtitle (if there is
one). If it gives liturgical details, it is a liturgical text and would have the Church as the main entry.<br>
Examples:<br>
<table border="0">
<tr><td align="left">110</td><td align="left"> 2  </td><td align="left"> Catholic Church.</td></tr>                 
<tr><td align="left">240</td><td align="left"> 10 </td><td align="left"> Psalter (Dominican).&#135;f1551</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">245</td><td align="left" valign="top"> 10 </td><td align="left"> Psalterium chorale fratru[m] S.
D[omi]nici :-bcum [ver]siculis, [reponsor]iis horarum, an[tiphon]is nocturnalibus, psalmis, hymnisq[ue] omnibus, cantu et litera.</td></tr>
</table></p>
<p>
<table border="0">
<tr><td align="left">110</td><td align="left"> 2  </td><td align="left"> Orthodox Eastern Church.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">245</td><td align="left" valign="top"> 14 </td><td align="left"> The Psalter, according to the Seventy,
of St. David, the prophet and King :&#135;btogether with the nine odes and an interpretation of how the Psalter should be recited
throughout the whole year</td></tr>
</table></p>
<p>
As a liturgical text the Psalter would be classified in one of the following four sections:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>BX370 (Orthodox Eastern Church)</li>
<li>BX2033 (Catholic Church)</li>
<li>BX5146; BX5946 (Church of England; Protestant Episcopal Church)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of the last two, the Psalter comprises a section of the Book of Common Prayer, which is common to both as members of the
Anglican Communion.</p>
<p>
Another major consideration is whether the purpose of the item in hand is to provide an artistic facsimile of a Psalter. <b>LCRI21.11B</b>
states: <em>&#34;Works using the word 'psalter', or a cognate, in the title proper or other title information are often reproductions of
medieval psalters, or of parts of these psalters, being published in order to present the art of the illustrative matter contained in the original
psalter. Enter these under the heading for the artist, or under title if the artist is unknown.  If the artist is unknown, the main entry will be
under title or uniform title. In this connection, note the utility of the headings provided by <b>25.13</b>. For example, the title of the work
may not be more than a general designation, e.g., <i>Der Psalter : eine Bilderhandschrift</i>. A uniform title, consisting of either the name of
the manuscript or the repository designation for the same -- according to the provisions of <b>25.13</b> -- is recommended for such
cases.&#34;</em> Also, one should take note of any other information pertaining to the manuscript. Just as liturgical directions are a clue
that the item is a liturgical book, details about the manuscript are a clue that the publication is artistic.<br>
Example:<br>

<h3><a name="subjects">SUBJECTS</a></h3>
<p>
There are two basic ways to deal with the Biblical treatment of subject terms. The first regards topics as subject matter in the Bible, i.e. How is
the particular subject treated in the Bible? What does the Bible have to say about a given subject? When that is the case, use the heading
<b>[Subject] in the Bible.</b><br>
Examples:<br>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Intercession in the Bible</li>
<li>Altars in the Bible</li>
<li>Knowledge, Theory of, in the Bible</li>
</ul>
These headings are established subjects in their own right, and the topics that are the basis of these headings must themselves be
established subject headings.</p>
<p>
The second method deals with established topical headings that are theological and/or ethical in nature. The pattern to be followed is:
<b>[Topic]&#135;xBiblical teaching.</b><br>
Examples:<br>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Obedience&#135;xBiblical teaching</li> 
<li>Sunday&#135;xBiblical teaching</li>
<li>Wealth&#135;xBiblical teaching</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><a href="#contents">Back to CONTENTS</a></p>
<h3><a name="subjsubdiv">SUBJECT SUBDIVISIONS</a></h3> 
<p>
While most subject subdivisions pertaining to the Bible are clear, there are a several that need comment. They are taken from the
<em>Subject cataloging manual: Subject headings. Pattern headings: Sacred works H 1188; Pattern: Bible.</em></p>
<p>
<b>&#135;xAccents and accentuation</b>. Deals with the Hebrew language and text, and therefore is only used under Bible.&#135;pO.T.
and individual books of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>
<b>&#135;xCanon</b>. Deals with the list of authorized books which are considered divinely inspired and thus are included in the Bible. The
list differs depending on the authorizing body: Jewish or Christian; and in the case of Christians, Catholic or Protestant. The canon, coming
from a Greek word for reed, with an extended meaning denoting measurement (hence a standard), is the authorized standard, or source, for
doctrine. Hence its use as the official term for the authorized list of Biblical books. The canon of the New Testament is the same for all
Christians. However, for the Old Testament there are differences depending on the original language, the authorizing religious organization,
etc.  For a substantial treatment of the matter,<a href="http://www.knight.org/advent/cathen/03267a.htm"> click here</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>&#135;xCanonical criticism</b>. A work of criticism dealing with the Bible or any of its parts, analysis of the canon (as described above)
being the principal or a major criterion.<br>
Examples:<br>
<table border="0">
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">245</td><td align="left" valign="top"> 10 </td><td align="left"> Interpreting Habakkuk as Scripture
:&#135;ban application of the canonical approach of Brevard S. Childs /&#135;cG. Michael O'Neal.</td></tr>

</table>
<p>
<b>&#135;vConcordances, [Language]&#135;x[Name of Version].</b> This subdivision can be qualified by language and version (if
necessary).<em> What is necessary to keep in mind is that in the 630 field you do not use the uniform title sections <b>&#135;l</b> and/or
<b>&#135;s</b>.</em> Those are reserved for the <b>730</b> field which provides an added entry for the specific text. The language of the
text (hence of the concordance), is brought out in the subdivision by extending the subdivision as indicated above. Follow
<b>Concordances</b> by a comma, followed by the authorized form of the language's name. If you need to account for a specific version,
type &#135;x and use the authorized form of the version. Examples:<br>
<br> 
<table border="0">
<tr><td align="left">245</td><td align="left"> 10 </td><td align="left"> Nelson's complete concordance of the Revised Standard version

</p>
<p>
In the last instance there is no <b>730</b> field on the record. This example demonstrates, as well as many others would do, that there is
some variety of practice dealing with concordances, and some of it is wrong. This record <em>should</em> include the 730 field(s),
<em>since a concordance is a related work</em>. <b>AACR2 21.28B1</b> explicitly states that an added entry should be made
<em>&#34;for the work to which it is related.&#34;</em></b><br> 
Another observed error is to include <b>Bible...&#135;l...xVersions...&#135;vConcordances</b> in the <b>630</b> field. But this also is
wrong. As will be seen shortly, <b>&#135;xVersions</b> deals only with translations as a subject. Therefore, to place it in a subject heading
dealing with concordances is out of place.</p>
<p>
<b>&#135;xCriticism, Form.</b>This is a type of criticism that combines historical and literary methods in order to determine the original
"form" of the Biblical text. It examines questions such as stages of oral tradition and stages of the literary text, when the oral tradition was
committed to textual form, and what literary form was used in the composition of the text.</p>
<p>
<b>&#135;xCriticism, interpretation, etc., Jewish.</b> This subdivision can only be used after <b>Bible.&#135;pO.T.</b> or individual
books of the Old Testament. It is used in order to distinguish actual Jewish interpretations, i.e. written by Jewish authors, from other
interpretations of the Old Testament. Much of the interpretation of the Jewish scriptures that has been written and published is by gentile
writers, chiefly Christians. This subdivision gives prominence to interpretation that is written within the original tradition, and has its own
methodology.</p>
<p>
<b>&#135;xCriticism, Narrative.</b> &#34;Narrative criticism, or narratology, a branch of literary criticism that has as its object the study of
the formal features of narrative texts. It is based on communication models of speech-act theory: the text conveys the message that the
author would deliver to the reader. The goal is to analyze the 'story world' of the narrative, and 'meaning' arises, not in the attempt to discern
the intentions of the author or to capture the affective force of the text, but in the encounter of the reader with the text.&#34; <u>The
HarperCollins Bible dictionary</u> (San Francisco: Harper, 1996) p. 739.</p>
<p>
<b>&#135;xCriticism, Redaction.</b> A method of criticism that &#34;applies to the way in which a text or tradition has been redacted or
edited. To engage in redaction criticism, one must be able to separate at least two stages of development in the use of a text... The redaction
critic's task is to analyze the individual instances where the editor has redacted an earlier text or tradition, assess the overall significance of
such changes, and interpret these in the light of the editor's literary and theological purpose.&#34; <u>Harper's Bible dictionary</u> (San
Francisco: Harper &#38; Row, 1986) p. 130-131.</p>
<p>
<b>&#135;xExtra-canonical parallels.</b> Use for material dealing with literature or situations outside the Bible that closely parallel the
content or style of the Bible in some way. The influence, real or alleged, can operate in either direction.<br>

<b>&#135;xInspiration.</b> A technical term referring to the divinely inspired nature of the Biblical text. It deals with how God influenced the
authors in the writing of the Biblical texts. This term is not to be confused with any aesthetic, psychological or devotional sense of the
word.</p>
<p>
<b>&#135;vLegends.</b> Used for collections of folk stories, children's literature and other traditional adaptations of Biblical material.<br>

<b>&#135;vLiturgical lessons, Dutch [English, etc.].</b> This subdivision refers to
the use of selections from the Bible as "readings" during  a liturgical service. These readings are usually organized by liturgical seasons. The
publication may be an official liturgical book, such as a lectionary; or it may be an unofficial publication put together on the basis of a

<p>
N.B. Recently this subdivision was given the status of <b>form</b> subdivision. But most examples of this subdivision antedate this
change. As in the examples above, you will often see <b>&#135;x</b> instead of <b>&#135;v</b>.</p>
<p>
<b>&#135;xVersions.</b> This heading is used to discuss collectively the translations of either the whole Bible or any of its parts. It is not
used as a form heading for actual translations. The Subject cataloging manual gives very detailed instructions in section <b>H 1300</b>. In
short, this subdivision can be extended further in the following ways:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>&#135;xVersions&#135;x[name of specific version]</b><br>  
Example:<br>
Bible&#135;xVersions&#135;xAuthorized</li>
<li><b>&#135;xVersions, [language group]</b><br> 
Example:<br>
Bible&#135;xVersions, African.<br>
Use the adjectival qualifier only for a language group, not for an individual language.</li>
<li>For a work discussing translations, or a particular translation, in a single language, follow this pattern:<br>
<b>Bible[.&#135;p[name of particular part, if necessary].&#135;l[language of
translation]&#135;xVersions&#135;x[name of version (e.g. Authorized), if
necessary]</b><br>
Examples:<br>
Bible.&#135;lLatin&#135;xVersions
Bible.&#135;lEnglish&#135;xVersions&#135;xNew World.</li>
<li><b>&#135;xVersions, [name of denomination].</b><br>
This is used collectively for works discussing translations produced by a particular church body: e.g., Bible&#135;xVersions, Catholic. If the
translations are also in a particular language, assign an additional heading for versions in that language: e.g.
Bible.&#135;lLatin&#135;xVersions.</li> 
<li><b>&#135;xVersions, Catholic vs. Protestant.</b><br>
Use this subdivision for works discussing the differences between Bibles translated by the respective denominations, e.g. the differences in
the canon of the Old Testament, use of language. Since many recent and current translations are ecumenical efforts, works needing this
subdivision are most likely to be published before 1960.</li>
