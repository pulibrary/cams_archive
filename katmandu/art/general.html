<p><strong>General Guidelines - Princeton cataloging for art, architecture, and photography</strong></p>

<p><a href="#1xx">1xx</a> * <a href="#245">245</a> * <a href="#246">246</a> * <a href="#5xx">5xx</a> * <a href="#6xx">6xx</a> </p>
<p><strong><a name="1xx"></a>1xx: Main Entry</strong></p>
<p>Determining the main entry for an art book:</p>
<p><em>Artist as main entry?</em></p>
<p>If the book <strong>contains</strong> reproductions of the  artist's works:
<p>If the person who wrote the catalog is represented  as the author of the book in the chief source of information, main entry is  under the heading for the person who wrote the book.
<ul>
  <li>Otherwise, enter the book under the heading for  the artist.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the book <strong>does not contain</strong> reproductions of the artist's  works, apply the following in the order listed:</p>
 <p>
   <ul>
     <li>If the book emanates from the corporate body that owns all the  works listed, enter it under the heading for the corporate body.<span dir="LTR"> </span>If the person or persons who wrote the book is known, enter the name(s)   according to AACR2.</li>
   </ul>
   <ul>
     <li>If neither of the above is applicable, enter the catalog under  its title. </li>
   </ul>
   Otherwise, enter it under the heading for the person who  wrote the book if that person is represented as the author in the chief source  of information.
 
 <blockquote>
   <p>If entry under the author of the text is not appropriate, enter under  title.</p>
    </blockquote>
  
    <p><em>Museum/Corporate body as main entry?
      </em>
    <p>This happens only for books about the works of two or more  artists if it meets all of the following conditions:    
    <ul>
        <li>It emanates from a corporate body</li>
        <li>All the works listed are held by the corporate body from which the catalog emanates
      
      (The presence of reproductions of the artists' works or text about the artists or artists' works is not a factor in choosing the main entry if the catalog meets the above criteria. If the catalog does not meet the criteria stated above, main entry will be the heading for the person who wrote the book or under title, as appropriate. )    </li>
      </ul>
      For a catalog of an exhibition of the works of a  single artist, the museum/corporate body can only be the main entry if the  catalog does not contain reproductions of the artist's works, and if the  catalog meets the four criteria listed above.
    <p>LCRI 21.1B2 gives some guidance on choice of entry  for Art Catalogs and Auction and Sales Catalogs.
    <p><strong><a name="245"></a>245: Transcription of Title, Other Title  Information, Statement of Responsibility</strong><br>
    <br>
In certain situations, clarification is needed regarding what constitutes the  title portion of an art book.</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>When the title proper consists of a list of artists' names, record all names in &Dagger;a. If the list is lengthy, the title proper may be abridged after the first five words,       followed by the mark of omission. Determination of how many names is &quot;lengthy&quot; is left to cataloger's judgment.</li>
    <li>When the other title       information consists of a list of artists' names, record all names in &Dagger;b.       If the list is lengthy, record only the first artist's name, followed by       the mark of omission. Determination of how many names is       &quot;lengthy&quot; is left to cataloger's judgment and local       institutional policy. </li>
    <li>For exhibition catalogs: when       found on the chief source of information, give the place and dates of the exhibition as other title information.</li></ol>
 <p><strong><a name="246"></a>246 Varying Form of Title</strong></p>
    Make added entries for variant forms of title as deemed important       according to individual cataloger's judgment and/or local institutional       policy. If the title proper of a book consists only of an artist's name,       and the other title information is more descriptive, make a variant title       entry for the other title information. If the title proper is a generic       phrase (e.g., &quot;new works,&quot; &quot;recent paintings&quot;) and the       other title information consists of the artist's name, make a variant title       entry for the other title information.<p> For exhibition catalogs, see:&nbsp;  ARLIS publication on <a href="http://www.arlisna.org/resources/onlinepubs/cataloging.pdf">Title and Statement of Responsibility</a>
    <p><br>
      <strong><a name="5xx"></a>5XX: Note Fields</strong>
      <ul type="disc">
    <li>Always make a 500 note for the       writer(s) of text, or the curator(s) for exhibitions, if they are found in       a source other than the chief source.</li>
    <li>For exhibition catalogs: if       the place(s) and date(s) of the exhibition are not included elsewhere in       the description (i.e., do not appear as other title information), record       them in a 500 note. For exhibitions held at more than three places, record       only the first named place with a phrase such as &quot;and 5 other museum&rdquo;       or &ldquo;5 other venues&quot; or &ldquo;5 other American museums&rdquo; to indicate that       there were more places of exhibition. If possible, add &ldquo;through [final       date]&rdquo;. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For exhibition catalogs, see:&nbsp;  ARLIS publication on <a href="#6xx">Notes</a></p>
  <p><strong><a name="6xx"></a>6XX: Subject Headings</strong></p>
  <ul type="disc">
    Provide at least one or two       subject headings, at the appropriate level of specificity, from LCSH. </li>
    <li>SCMs <a href="pdfs/artcat_H1250.pdf">&nbsp;H 1250</a> and <a href="pdfs/artcat_ H1148.pdf">H 1148</a> give detailed guidance for architecture       books on the work of one architect or firm: </li>
    <li>For art books: </li>
    <li>If the book is about a single artist's works, make a subject       entry for the artist's name. For exhibition catalogs, assign the       free-floating subdivision &Dagger;vExhibitions. Do <strong>not</strong> further subdivide &Dagger;vExhibitions       by &Dagger;vCatalogs. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>For artistic photography       books: </li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="disc">
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>For the work of a single photographer: </li>
      <ul type="square">
        <li>For publications         consisting chiefly of photographs whose main purpose is photography as a         fine art, assign the heading &quot;Photography, Artistic&quot; or &quot;Photography,         Artistic&Dagger;vExhibitions.&quot; &quot;Photography, Artistic&quot; is <strong>not</strong> subdivided geographically. </li>
        <li>For books of or about         photographs on a particular theme or photography of a particular type         (e.g., &quot;Fashion photography,&quot; &ldquo;Photography of trees,&rdquo; etc.),         assign a heading for the theme or type. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Assign a heading for the        name of the photographer (with subdivision &Dagger;vExhibitions if appropriate). </li>
      <li>If the photographs are        part of an institution's permanent collection, assign a heading for the        institution with subdivision &Dagger;Catalogs or, if appropriate,&nbsp; &Dagger;vExhibitions.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>    SCM &nbsp;<a href="pdfs/artcat_ H1255.pdf">H 1255</a>  gives detailed guidance.</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>For architecture books on the       work of one architect or firm: </li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="disc">
    <ul type="circle">
      <li>Assign a heading for the        name of the architect or firm (with subdivision &Dagger;vExhibitions if        appropriate). </li>
      <li>If the book concerns        the architect&rsquo;s or firm&rsquo;s works in one country or region, assign        architecture headings for that country or region, subdivided by &Dagger;xHistory&Dagger;y[century].</li>
      <li>If the book concerns        one building in a city, assign a 610 for the building and the        corresponding heading &Dagger;a[city heading]&Dagger;xBuildings, structures, etc.</li>
      <li>If the book concerns        architecture in a city or cities, add heading(s) for &Dagger;a[city        heading]&Dagger;xBuildings, structures, etc.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>For subject subdivision, note that rules for art differ from other       subjects, including architecture and photography.</ul>

   <p>  <strong>7XX: Added Entries</strong><br>
                <br>
                There are two kinds of added entries for art books:              </p>
              <ol start="1" type="1">
                <li>If the main entry of the       catalog is the artist, make an added entry for the person who wrote the       text if his or her name appears anywhere in the item. For exhibition       catalogs, make an added entry for the curator if his or her name appears       anywhere in the item.&nbsp; <em>It may be necessary to search for the       curator&rsquo;s name on t.p. verso or in colophon.</em></li>
                <li>For exhibition catalogs, make       an added entry for the corporate heading of the institution in which an       art exhibition is held. Make an added entry under the heading for each       institution if there are three or fewer, or for the first if there are       four or more. </li>
